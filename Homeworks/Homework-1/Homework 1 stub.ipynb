This is what I love about good science fiction - it pushes your thinking about where things can go. \\n It is a 2015 Hugo winner, and translated from its original Chinese, which made it interesting in just a different way from most things I\\'ve read. For instance the intermixing of Chinese revolutionary history - how they kept accusing people of being \"reactionaries\", etc. \\n It is a book about science, and aliens. The science described in the book is impressive - its a book grounded in physics and pretty accurate as far as I could tell. Though when it got to folding protons into 8 dimensions I think he was just making stuff up - interesting to think about though. \\n But what would happen if our SETI stations received a message - if we found someone was out there - and the person monitoring and answering the signal on our side was disillusioned? That part of the book was a bit dark - I would like to think human reaction to discovering alien civilization that is hostile would be more like Enders Game where we would band together. \\n I did like how the book unveiled the Trisolaran culture through the game. It was a smart way to build empathy with them and also understand what they\\'ve gone through across so many centuries. And who know a 3 body problem was an unsolvable math problem? But I still don\\'t get who made the game - maybe that will come in the next book. \\n I loved this quote: \\n \"In the long history of scientific progress, how many protons have been smashed apart in accelerators by physicists? How many neutrons and electrons? Probably no fewer than a hundred million. Every collision was probably the end of the civilizations and intelligences in a microcosmos. In fact, even in nature, the destruction of universes must be happening at every second--for example, through the decay of neutrons. Also, a high-energy cosmic ray entering the atmosphere may destroy thousands of such miniature universes....\"',\n",

The current release is a DIPA, which frankly is the only cauldron I'm familiar with (it was an IPA/DIPA the last time I ordered a cauldron at the horsebrass several years back). In any event... at the Horse Brass yesterday.\\t\\tThe beer pours an orange copper color with good head retention and lacing. The nose is all hoppy IPA goodness, showcasing a huge aroma of dry citrus, pine and sandlewood. The flavor profile replicates the nose pretty closely in this West Coast all the way DIPA. This DIPA is not for the faint of heart and is a bit much even for a hophead like myslf. The finish is quite dry and hoppy, and there's barely enough sweet malt to balance and hold up the avalanche of hoppy bitterness in this beer. Mouthfeel is actually fairly light, with a long, persistentely bitter finish. Drinkability is good, with the alcohol barely noticeable in this well crafted beer. Still, this beer is so hugely hoppy/bitter, it's really hard for me to imagine ordering more than a single glass. Regardless, this is a very impressive beer from the folks at Caldera.\",\n",

       "  'review/text': 'OK, so the only reason I bought this while shopping at Whole Foods was because I\\'ve never had a \"ginger beer\" unless it was ginger ALE...and we all know that\\'s not the kind of \"beer\" we\\'re interested in on this site! I was very excited to try this one!...\\t\\tWhen poured out it looks like a cheapo macro lager at first sight, then the slowly fading head suggests otherwise. The body is crystal clear and is a very light straw color. The head is bright white and slowly dissipates, but is initially quite thick.\\t\\tSmell is adjuncty, but there are slight notes of honey and some kind of herby thing going on...ginger perhaps? Can\\'t really tell. From the smell there is obviously something different about this beer though. It has a unique spicy smell to it and reminds me a lot of basil, not ginger. I really can\\'t quite place everything that I smell, but it is a very nice aroma. Superb fragrance for this beer, though definitely not a \"ginger beer\" based on the smell.\\t\\tThe taste is very unique also. It\\'s kind of like a spiced pilsner or kolsch but the \"spice\" is kind of hard to identify. It does not taste like ginger. This beer actually reminds me a lot of Bison\\'s Honey Basil ale. There is some definite astringent burn in the upper throat after swallowing that is no doubt from the ginger, but that is the only ginger I can detect with any certainty. It is only slightly hoppy and malty.\\t\\tThis a very enjoyable, very drinkable beer (I could easily drink 2 22oz\\'ers) but I think it\\'s failing in its claim to be a \"ginger\" beer because I don\\'t smell it, can barely taste it, and can only really detect the ginger\\'s physiological effects of a warm throat and stomach. So, rating this one is hard; I\\'ve never had a ginger beer so I don\\'t really know what one ought to taste like...but then again I can\\'t really tell if I\\'m tasting ginger here or the combination of other things. So confused. My recommendation to you Caldera folks: ADD MORE GINGER! There\\'s obviously enough of a curiosity about this style to not hurt sales if it was strengthened. I for one could handle it.',\n",

       "  'review/text': 'Caldera presents yet another circumstance where the brewery does not operate a brewpub, doesnt bottle their beers, and is located 300 miles from my home. To review their beers I traveled to their hometown of Ashland, OR and drank at the Ashland Creek Bar and Grill. This may have been a mistake. \\t\\t\\tThough I had other reasons to visit Ashland, its disappointing (to say the least) to travel 300 miles and be served a spoiled beer. Both the Oatmeal Stout and Ashland Amber were of poor quality at the Ashland Creek Bar and Grill. In the case of the Oatmeal Stout, a nice measure of cream and a wayward thread of mint were marred by a sulfuric smell and likely bacterial infection. Though I cant say for certain, my best guess is that the house tap lines were something other than sanitized. \\t\\t\\tI will attempt to revisit and re-evaluate this beer. But for the time being, its important to ask a pertinent question about quality control. Caldera is a 10 bbl microbrewery in a small town. How much responsibility do they have towards assuring that taps serving their product in their hometown are kept reasonably clean and free of bacterial encroachment? My answer to this question is that the brewery does have some responsibility to assure quality pours in its own hometown. This is especially so when they operate no pub of their own. Not only does this effort protect the consumer from being served a spoiled beer, but the enforcement of quality control measures at the point of consumption simply makes good business sense. \\t\\t\\tTill then, theres nothing I really care say about this beer other than to wish whoever pursues it greater luck than I had at Ashland Creek.',\n",

Very strong different smoky flavor but Good. \\t\\tGood carbonation. Smooth and Medium bodied.\\t\\tOverall at some point in trying this beer You Will Say Holy Shit!

Its not so much as 'bad' as opposed to 'challenging'. I must admit, I could not even finish a taster of it. This is the most intense smoked beer I've ever come across, by far.

I\\'ll leave it at that and hope I don\\'t O.D. off this 22 ounce bottle. On to the beer:\\t\\tThe chestnut colored body is a looker in the stange glass. On top, the head has a beige color, a somewhat creamy texture, several groupings of lace sticking around and retention. The rauch part is done extremely well; mouth-watering jerkied meats stand out above with a little sweetness and a kiss of leafy hop. \\t\\tThere\\'s a lot of meat on the bones of this beer. Loads and loads and maltiness and medium smokiness make this a winner. The two run in sperate stages and never cross into each other\\'s territory, which in this case I adore. Its got the smokiness that I would find in a summer sausage. On the malty side, there\\'s loads of caramel. Little notes of ash give me the impression that I\\'m at a campfire. Hints of brown sugar. Alcohol slowly gets noticed, but in a good way; here it brings notes of raisin. There is a moderate hoppiness that can be sensed for a brief second, catch it before the smoke and malt beat it down. On the fuller side in terms of mouthfeel, quite smooth with the bubbles very small yet enough to be felt. \\t\\tIf I hadn\\'t stuffed myself with Chinese food earlier in the night, I may have been more tempted to overdose on Rauch Ur Bock. Only kidding, I have a good idea when to stop. Warning, you may be temped buy more bottles after you try your first. In short, superb.',\n",

Not the smokiest or most pungent smoke profile I've experienced, but damn up there. and I think it's the intense rich malt and sweetness from the malt that keeps the smoke slightly tamed. A touch of lemon and citrus fruitiness in the finish which blends perfectly with the cherry smoke.\\t\\tIt's not as crisp or dry as other Rachbiers, and it seems a bit more full-bodied, with almost a touch of syrupiness to it. which is kind of an interesting take on it.

I think this is probably my favorite domestically produced Rauchbier I've had the pleasure of tasting. It really hits on all cylinders.

Nice. \\t\\tDrinkability is really quite good for such a smoke bomb.

       "  'review/text': 'This beer pours a very clear and attractive shade of ruby brown. Much less dark than I had anticipated, and carrying a diminutive, but attractive head of parchment foam that leaves very nice lace. The smoky aroma of this beer is very nice. It smells like the smoke that would waft from the smoker at a little restaurant in my home town of Traverse City, Michigan. Porky, sweet and delectable with notes of brown sugar. I suddenly have a huge craving for an \"all meat mess.\" The flavor is also quite nice in that the smoke is not too overpowering. Other flavors include sweet dark malt, brown sugar, a bit of cinnamon and leather. Quite nice and well blended. The body is medium with a mouthfeel that seems a bit sticky, but is pretty good. Surprisingly drinkable, and would be great (of course) with BBQ. Not the first smoked beer I have had, but the first I have reviewed. This one makes me want to seek out more.',\n",

What remains is a broken swirl of film and a creamy ring. Decent streaming carbonation.\\t\\tS: Lovely of savory smoke and sugared spiciness...a malty, caramel-laden lager covered gently with grainy husks, burnt yet surprisingly sweet. Strong enough to be smelled from 1-foot away in a crowded room. \\t\\tT: Toffee and spice (notable cinnamon) with a candied fruit after-effect. Oh yeah, a good deal of smoke - a sweet mesquite, reminiscent of barbecued brisket. Herbed and a little tang in the finish. Enough intonations of fruit and a fleeting tartness.\\t\\tM: Velvety feel with a slight prickle (less from carbonation, more from an earthy ground spice). Medium body that borders on heaviness (not unexpected: it IS over 7%). Maltiness coats but isn't cloying; smoke doesn't intrude too much. \\t\\tD: Despite a heavenly aroma and feel and good flavor, this 'only' can muster a 4.0, simply due to a hefty alcohol girth. It's a touch on the sweet side (ur-bock) but the smokiness is well done. Sure it's worth a glass (or two) and is one I'd definitely have again.\",\n",

       "  'review/text': '12 oz. can poured into a pint glass. I really like cans for beers like pale ales that are not meant for cellaring and am glad to have another one available in SoCal. Cool green tab but sadly no canning or best by date.\\t\\tPours a nice rich gold with a pure white head that grows excessively. Slow pour down a tilted glass and cannot even get the whole can into a pint glass. The retention is good, however, and lacing is great. Lots of bubbles cascading upwards from the bottom of the glass. The aroma is mild and consists of a bit of hoppy earthiness and some candied oranges.\\t\\tThe flavor starts with a mild hops bittering and quickly adds a touch of sweetness to balance it out. Earthy and slightly piney with bitter sappy sugar.. The bittering is not high, but there is little aroma hopping evident or much malt complexity either. This is a very light pale ale with little going on beyond some bittering hops, leaving a slightly floral but vegetal finish. An okay beer for a local brewpub, but not quite up to the standard of most pale ales in distribution. Light bodied, creamy, lots of smooth bubbles.\\t\\tA simple beer, but not really in a good way. This needs some more aroma hopping or some other type of complexity. Long floral/vegetal finishing damages drinkability. Unless one is dying to try a new pale ale, I would not recommend this.',\n",

Big head of white foam on top that barely falls back down to earth. Wonderful clear amber color that really just looks the part perfectly. Lots of carbonation creeping up the glass throughout And a really nice coating of spider like webbing.\\t\\tSmell - Aroma is lighter then I would have thought. Nice light grains, a touch of piney hops. As it warms a bit of citrus starts to come though, but again, lighter then I would have thought.\\t\\tTaste - Crisp, clean, the first sip has a biting touch to it as the pine and citrus start to roll through. Nice grains come in mid palate and then it rolls right back into a nice and dry bitter finish. Clean aftertaste leaves you to come back and look for a bit more.\\t\\tFeel - Light, airy and well carbonated. I had no issue at all with going forward with this one. The feel matched the overall experience very nicely.\\t\\tDrinkability - Session able, very nice and clean and easy drinking. Again had really no issue at all with putting this one away.\\t\\tOverall - Solid. Nothing earth shattering here but very solid. I would not mind at all grabbing a six pack and heading to the beach.

Single purchased at Wine Warehouse (Charlottesville, VA) for $2.15.\\t\\tA: Honey-orange with solid 2-finger ivory head with decent retention and only a crown of lace.\\t\\tS: Plenty of hops in this one with above-average pale malt backbone with leafy and grapefruit aromas dominating.\\t\\tT: The flavor is good but a touch flat for the style, owing mainly to the lack of character in the maltload. The malt component is not quite sweet or roasted enough, which leaves a somewhat bland quality to this aspect. The hops are highly bitter and pretty harsh: a little more floral and citrus character would blend better with the ambiguous malting. Motwithstanding, this is an above-average APA without a doubt.\\t\\tM: Feel is a little thin for the style, although not far off with a medium-light body. Carbonation is a bit too short in supply. The aftertaste is very long with bitter and leafy hops notes persisting.\\t\\tD: A pretty good APA with a big price tag relatively. Solid and highly bitter for the style and could use a little more finesse. Still, enjoyable and didn't last long.\",\n",

The aroma is the strong point - assertively grainy with a crisp hop aroma, mostly grassy with a little flower. I really looked forward to tasting this beer. But it was weaker than I might have hoped, with less of a malt backbone that the aroma suggested and more emphasis on the flowery side of hop character. The bitterness rests, curiously, mostly on the foretaste, with relatively little clinging to the back. The mouthfeel is quite thin, almost insubstantial.\\t\\tThis is a decent beer, but nothing to get excited about.',\n",

I havn't been this excited for a Pale ale since my very first Sierra Nevada!!(circa 1996)\\t\\t This pale ale in a can has made my day, and I'm camping in one of the most pristine locations I've ever been too.

Smells like a pale ale. \\t\\tThis is a nice brew. The flavor is present & accounted for without being overwhelming. I think this would be a superb gateway beer for a BMC drinker - there's not so much flavor to cause anyone to drop their Coors Light & run screaming, but it has enough for us dedicated beer freaks to have a sip & go...mmm. That's nice. The lighter flavor, I've noticed, encourages bigger sips, & I'm trying not to gulp this one down too fast. It's a long night. Pace yourself. \\t\\tDid I hear session beer? This would be a great beer to find on tap at the local pub, tasty, easy-drinking, but with a low enough ABV that you're not playing bumper cars in the lot after three of them. That's two very good beers from this mystery brewery. I will stop by if I'm ever in the neighborhood.\",\n",

       "  'review/text': \"Can from Beer Run, Charlottesville, VA, enjoyed on site during Super Bowl Sunday. Poured into a traditional American pint glass that came chilled, so I had to give it a chance to warm and wipe it down.\\t\\tAppearance: Pours a surprisingly light and transparent golden yellow - I'm hesitant to say urine, but, you know - with an initially foamy two-finger head that fades into a relatively healthy sheen pretty quickly and leaves lots of scraggly, fluffy, cloud-like lacing streaming upwards towards the rim. The collar if thick and fluffy, though light looking. A solid start.\\t\\tAroma: Buttery, slightly spicy malt notes, cracker and biscuit-like, with a few light fruity esters - perhaps hoppy in origin, perhaps yeasty in origin, coming across as pineapple in places - mingling with some heavier, definitively hoppy citrus notes, and plenty of grassy, spicy notes. Perfectly pleasant.\\t\\tTaste: Very balanced for a pale ale, almost ESB like. The malt profile here is large and in charge, very graham cracker/biscuit like, perhaps slightly buttery in places. Malt bitterness is mild to perhaps moderate, slightly herbal and grassy, lacking a lot of those good west coast hop notes that I'd like out of, well, a west coast hopped ale. It's almost cinnamony in places, probably a result of the hop notes. Odd but interesting.\\t\\tMouthfeel: Incredibly smooth and soft, gently carbonated, leading to a very creamy and subtle mouthfeel, a feel which works well with the malt profile on this one. Very very nice.\\t\\tDrinkability: This was a strange and somewhat unexpected brew. Not quite your traditional west coast pale ale, heavy on the bitterness, citrus, and minty hops with a heavily roasted but still sweet malt backbone to back it up; this one is more heavy on lighter, spicier, grassy hop notes and has a surprisingly light and dry malt foundation. Nonetheless, it's still nice, pleasant, and went well with the first six minutes of SuperBowl XLIII!\",\n",

It's a good Pale Ale, and rather sessionable, but for a dollar more I could get Bell's Hopslam or Troeg's Nugget Nectar. Not that those beers are necessarily and better or more desirable, but you get a hyped high gravity beer for a dollar more that an ordinary Pale Ale? Anyway, it's an enjoyable beer.

Surprisingly fruity, but not in an alarmingly sweet sort of way. There\\'s a leafiness to the hops, as well. Kinda like if a canned Dole snack was hopped. \\t\\tT: Herbal and slightly citrusy hops.

I wasn\\'t sure what to expect from this brew, but it\\'s quite tasty. \\t\\tM + D: Kind of lacking in body and carbonation - not flat, but almost \"muddy.\" Something is missing here, though I can\\'t place a finger on what. All in all, it\\'s quite a tasty brew, but the price is very high in these parts (Virginia). They offer reasons as to why they cost more on the webpage, but I have trouble with the reasoning for it. That alone would be the deal-breaker for buying more, unfortunately. If cost of a product is not an issue, by all means, get some - it is good beer!',\n",

I love the town it comes from - Ashland, Oregon - and I thought to myself that a place like Ashland must have the creative spirit to produce something unique. Well, this beer was unique, alright. I can't recall ever drinking another beer with a hop flavor like boiled vegetables. Blech! Appearance was average, and head retention was so-so. I noticed no lacing whatsoever. Smell did not reveal what the taste had in store. On first sip, I noticed nothing immediately untoward, but as the hop flavor built so did the unwelcome overcooked-vegetable flavor. I tried another can the next day thinking that maybe I just had a bad one, but with the same result. I'm afraid I won't be trying this one again, and wouldn't recommend it to anybody else. You could do worse, but to me this beer would be a last resort before having to accept a macrobrew.\",\n",

More sweet and less toasted malt than the Dale's. I'd have a hard time deciding on a favorite between the appearance and aroma, but very slightly prefer the taste I had yesterday - both probably should rate about a 4.25. Caldera is more bitter - that isn't a bad thing - and has a noticeably dryer finish. \\tBody is on the light side of medium - seems slightly thinner than Dale's - while carbonation is crisp and appropriate. \\tFinal verdict? Another extremely drinkable brew, and another fantastic canned beer for my forays to the pool or wherever glass isn't allowed/convenient.\",\n",

       "  'review/text': \"Although my can sloshed about (it was short-filled and measured exactly 11 ounces), it didn't seem to affect the flavor or carbonation. I noticed no oxidation whatsoever. It poured a just-slightly-hazy golden body beneath a short head of frothy white foam. The head dwindled down to a creamy surface covering, and then shrank away to a wide collar and whispy surface covering; leaving behind tiny-spotted walls of lace. Bright hops, sweetish malt, and yeasty fruitiness greeted me in the nose, expressing soft citrus, sweetish grainy malt, berries, and cut-grass. It's soft carbonation and medium-light body left it remarkably smooth across the palate. The flavor delivered a rich maltiness upfront that wasn't quite caramelish or toasty, but headed there; followed by an influx of grassy and citrusy hop flavors; and then some berry-like fruitiness at the swallow. The bitterness roses up strong, and although some sticky malt lingered in the mouth, it was bitter, dry, grassy and spicy in the finish. It lingered momentarily with some strength, and then faded to a dull bitterness, leaving me ready for another sip. Quite the little charmer, I say! I love the flavor transition from quaint, sweetish, straight-forward and non-caramelish maltiness, to bold, grassy, citrusy, and bitter hops!!! The apple-ish and berry-like fruitiness is just the icing on the cake that ties the two together. Well-balanced with a very nice complexity and full character, and still not overdone. Worth trying!\",\n",

The beer is a cloudy yellow with a nice head that fell after a couple of minutes. The smell is very malty for a APA and has a nice hint of floral hops. The taste is very well balance between malt and hops. Not overly bitter or hoppy, but right on for a pale ale. This a a very good interpretation of the style and unique with the nice malt presence. Mouthfeel is on the medium side and the drinkability is good a well. This woould make a very good session beer if it were regularly available to me.

Appealing aroma of lightly sweet malt, floral hops, and a touch of fruit and caramel.

The glass residue is so fine and spider web-like that it resembles actual lace. Drinking this beer out of the can and missing an appearance like this should be a criminal offense.\\t\\tThe nose is outstanding (see 'drinking... can... criminal offense' above) and puts a huge number of IPAs to shame. The pithy pungency of the Cascade hops fairly leaps out of the glass, with the overall aroma made deeper and more interesting by a much lesser quantity of spicy Perle hops. Great job Caldera. Even if the flavor is on the pedestrian side, the nose is a world-class sprinter.\\t\\tThe flavor doesn't measure up to those stratospheric heights, but that's not to say this isn't a deliciously hoppy pale ale. Emphasis on hoppy. The brewers made sure their beer would last a good, long while by packaging it in light-rejecting aluminum and by adding an impressive amount of hops. Sweet, spicy and juicy white grapefruit is front, center and back. I love the slight variation on the usual Pacific NW flavor profile that the German hops provide.\\t\\tAPAs don't need to be complex to suit me (this one isn't), they just need to be bursting with pale malt-supported bitter hoppiness (this one is). There's enough sweetness on hand to keep things kinda, sorta balanced from a hophead's perspective, although the pucker factor is still decidedly high. The mouthfeel is light-medium and perfectly carbonated; the better to down a few cans on a hot summer day without a second thought.\\t\\tCaldera Brewing Company is anything but a household name (unless one lives in Ashland, Oregon or its environs), but this little brewery has just provided me with the best beer that I've ever had out of a can. I was tempted to say 'that I'll ever', but ever is a long time. I do know this, it's unlikely to be topped for a very long time.\",\n",

Oranges or tangerines. Light citrus and pine hops as well.\\t\\tWell balanced in the taste. Citrus and pine hops dominate the taste buds, but balance themselves out nicely to create a drinkable and hoppy pale ale. The bitterness comes on at first like its going to be overdone, but then backs down just at the right moment to make for a very nice sipping experience. Tangerines definitely make their way into the taste as well, not tangy at all, just sweet and estery. Easy to drink and heavy enough for the hopheads, yet soft enough for every one else. Long dry finish, hoppy til the bitter end, leaving a nicely pleasant bitter aftertaste. Decent beer, no complaints here for trying it.',\n",

The bubbles stuck around for a while before slowly dissipating, leaving behind tons of lace.\\t\\tThe nose is grainy up front...lots of grass mixed with hops. Corn and caramel malts are in the background.\\t\\tWhile the caramel malts play a background role in the nose, they take front and center in the taste. Sweet and almost chewy, the candy corn middle fades slightly while the bitterness of the hops finish things off. \\t\\tThe mouthfeel is on the lighter side of medium, moderate carbonation and a little slick.\\t\\tThis is a pretty odd beer...has hops that are not in the flavor...the taste has the flavors of a (weak) barleywine, but the body is not there...but overall, this is still a tasty offering.',\n",

This smells a bit less sweet than their amber but otherwise seems the same. The IPA smells a lot better.\\t\\tT. Sweet with some english/american grassy hops. These could be american hops but there's something very english tasting here. The hops finish with enough bite here which the smell and opening taste don't seems to hint at. \\t\\tD.

       "  'review/text': \"Well balanced between caramel maltiness and citrusy hops, this beer exemplifies the Pale Ale style nicely.\\t\\tAn expected deep golden to light copper color does the beer pour. Froathy head character amounts to an inch or so before settling it's white lace on the glass. Good retention, but great on lacing. A classic Pale Ale appearance.\\t\\tCaramel, spice, and hops blend in the nose for the impression of graham crackers, orange rinds, and a touch of ginger. Very appealing aroma that doesn't let the hops nor the malt gain precidence.\\t\\tSweet maltiness sets the tone for taste with a medium caramel flavor, cracker-like breadiness, and a light grainy or crusty taste that gives a slight bite that ushers in the hop flavor and bitterness. Grapefruit, orange zest, and light grassy notes peak through early, but grow in intensity until the malt sweetness waivers, giving the finish and aftertaste a decidedly bitter ending to an otherwise balanced beer.\\t\\tMalt sweetness gives a fuller, rounder sensation to the mouth, while the hops and moderate alcohol provide a drying and crispening finish. Though not complete in dryness or crispness in finish, the beer holds onto enough malt character to attempt balance deep in the finish and aftertaste.\\t\\tWith relatively low/no flaws in execution, the recipe formulation leads to a somewhat one-dimentional caramel malt sweetness that wears on the palate and hurts the sessionability of the beer. And with the standard malt/hop balance, there's not much intrigue to keep me comming back.\",\n",

Big, rocky eggshell white head rises and clings to the glass with each sip leaving an absolutely beautiful lacing behind.\\t\\tAroma- Bright hop aromas of grapefruit, pithy orange peel, and slightly pungent pine. Healthy burnt sugar and sweet malty undertones with a whisper of mineral-like yeastiness. \\t\\tFlavor- Nice balance from start through the middle and into the finish with soft caramel/burnt sugar maltiness and a hearty pungent citrusy vein of hop goodness. Bitterness and hop pungency intensifies into finish and lingers well beyond the exhale with a kiss of cracker-like light malt. Very refreshing, crisp, and edgy pale ale! \\t\\tMouthfeel- Light to medium bodied, low-moderate residual sugars, moderate CO2. Nice balance, but definitely some sticky hoppiness to this brew. Refreshing with an edgy, pungent, minerally dryness in finish. \\t\\tOverall- This is ridiculously drinkable and just about everything you would want in a pale ale! Big hops, but nice dose of flavor, aroma, and bitterness in there. Just the right amount of malt sweetness to keep drinkability high. This would make an excellent lawnmower beer, but still has enough complexity/flavor to be a great pair with food- I'm thinking pulled pork and slaw, or anything spicy.

       "  'review/text': \"Poured into a 7oz. snifter.\\t\\tAppearance: Poured out quite nicely: produced one finger's worth of fluffy, off-white head, which came to rest atop a crystal clear, golden body. Faint streams of carbonation did their best to keep that head up, but it eventually faded to a sticky crown. Bubblebath-like lacing trailed the beer all the way to the bottom of the glass. Nice.\\t\\tSmell: Pineapple + cat pee = Simcoe. Those are the two aromas I got right off the bat. Pine bark, wholegrain toast, and lime also pulled through. If I could guess, I'd say the hop bill includes late additions of Simcoe and Amarillo hops. Not bad, but not what I typically prefer in a pale either.\\t\\tTaste: Whole grains, butter and dough form a lovely malt backbone. Lemon zest accents that backbone, while woody hops create a bold, bitter aftertaste. Not sure how old this can is, but I love the malt-hop balance, which is tilted just a bit toward the malty end of the spectrum.\\t\\tMouthfeel: Caldera Pale Ale's active yet soft, rolling carbonation massaged my palate for the entire session. The body is light, crisp, and very refreshing. To top things off, the beer finishes bitter but not too dry, and leaves a flavorful, long-lasting aftertaste. It don't get any better than this. Perfect!\\t\\tDrinkability: The more I drink this, the more it reminds me of New Belgium's Ranger IPA (in a pale ale form, of course). I didn't expect a whole lot out of this one going in, but I finished it in a flash! Will definitely buy more if I come across it again.\",\n",

       "  'review/text': 'Beer review from BA Mag Oct 2007.\\t\\tThe more craft beers that come in cans, the more the stigma that surrounds canned beer will fade away--plus, there is no debate about sunlight and bottle color. That dead horse has been beaten way too much.\\t\\tThin tiny-bubbled lace forms from a moderate pour, retention is fine and the lace stays around for most of the session. Brilliant golden color shimmers in the light. Flowery citric hop aroma screams Cascade hops, bit of biscuity malt with a mild caramel sweetness in the nose. Light to medium body with just as much smoothness and crispness, both with ample amounts for the semislick mouthfeel. Minty and earthy yet mainly citric-flavored hop draws in a lot of flavor with a solid bitterness. Very clean palate with bread notes, almost grassy graininess in the middle. Hop bitterness digs in deep but does not go too far to throw anything out of balance. Cascade hops are all over the finish with an earthy citric flavor. Ends with a touch of dry maltiness.\\t\\tA benchmark ale for PNW Pale Ales, if not American Pale Ales altogether, and that benchmark is not of modest stature. It shows great balance without the Cascade smack taking over, clean and very drinkable. The last of the sample was paired with a plain goat cheese and Pink Lady apples--very nice.',\n",

I'd leave it at that but I suppose a person wants to know a little more. A big sip delivers a bitter hoppy bite that is subdued calmly and respectably by a dose of malty medicine.

Great pale ale from the folks in Shakespeare land.\\t \\tOverall - I really enjoyed this pale ale. This is a very drinkable brew and I mean that in every way possible. Its simple yet flavorful, hoppy but also balanced. Its simply a very good beer. \\t \\tWould I buy more of it? - absolutely.

Ok, now the grain surpasses the hops and everything else and I\\'m saying what? I have mixed feelings on the smell, which, don\\'t get me wrong, isn\\'t bad, it ends up being good. \\t\\tThe taste is a battle between the hoppy bitterness which is, really, a nice light citrus combined with some pine, and a strong grainy flavour that for me, seems out of place for an APA. Hell yes, I like a good malty presence in the style but I\\'d rather have some sweet caramel taste to balance the hops than an all out frontal attack of grain and grain is what is distracting me. To no good end. Dang.\\t\\tOn the high end of light bodied, lowish level of carbo. The mouthfeel is just fine.\\t\\tDrinkability? I\\'ve noticed after further sipping that the combination of the hops and grain make for an undesirable, to me, bitterness in the finish so...I\\'m glad this is only 12oz. I\\'m not fond of this but I\\'d like to take a stab at Caldera\\'s other offerings. I never judge a brewery based on a one and only beer I\\'ve had from them. ;^)',\n",

Color was a slightly-hazy honey-yellow. Remember, kids, clarity is overrated! Nose was grapefruit-citrusy. Pale Ale, bah! In many of our Central-Southern states, this would have been their IPA. I began to weep at the thought of previous recent CANs like Lone Star and Stack - rubbish in a CAN! Recovering, I took a sip and got a mouthful of full-on Cascade hops! Zounds! Yoi and double yoi! If this was simply their Pale Ale, it struck me as to why I loved their IPA in a CAN so much. I may have found a new favorite brewery for CANs... I allowed myself to luxuriate a little more fully in the second sip. It was very citrusy on the palate and even a little grainy, as though the liquid were saturated by hops. No matter, because on the swallow, it was so dry that I could not help but reach for another sip. More, please, sir.\",\n",

Medium bodied, adequate carbonation. Definitely a refreshing, milder alternative to many pale ales currently out there.',\n",

The citrus hops are very intense and at first appear to be overtaking the nose but then the grain proves to be a bit more stubborn. Together they form a fair balance and a beautiful APA bouquet.\\t\\tTaste - The hops are more forward at the taste but the grain holds its own. It's easy to wax on about the hops because they are big and exceptional, but I'm going to talk about the grain here a bit. They are light for sure but show a sharpness not often found in the style. This IMO allows the hops to stand out without being overbearing.\\t\\tMouthfeel - This is bigger than a light lager but not medium-bodied. There's a bitterness here that is somewhat mild but forceful in that it finds its way throughout the mouth from beginning to end.\\t\\tDrinkability - I was very impressed with this Caldera can.

This is a great neighborhood bar, with a fine, if not huge selection of beer, and deserves some spillover beer geek traffic once the Clinton Street Theater's brewpub opens down the street. Anyway, the porter is lighter than your typical porter black, more of a transparent ginger brown. The head is small but the lacing is determined. The aroma is mild rainy day, and the flavor profile contains deep caramel, light smokiness, cured meat, cola, and a tart herbal quality that masks the malt sweetness. It is not an exceptional beer but it satisfies and provides a lighter counterpoint to Caldera's rich coffee/Cauldron stouts.\",\n",

Head is thin and fleeting, the small amount that sticks around is like cream poured in a latte. Smell is a light belgian roastiness, something like a sweetness mixed with coffee and a slight amount of bread. It's very faint, hard to pull out any specific aromas.\\t\\tTaste is great, a roasty brown ale with a belgian-friendly slant. The yeast lightens up the beer considerably, very thin up front with most of the body in the middle and finish. The sweetness hits first, followed by the roasty flavors and orange bitters in the back end. Nothing in the beer is really overpowering, but it's not weak, just tame. On the whole, it seems like there's a tendency to go crazy in the BSDA category, this is a reserved offering that's great for a nice relaxing evening, definitely in opposition to what the label may suggest.\",\n",

The good looking lid of golden khaki is not Belgianesque... nor was it expected to be. Thick streamers of sudsy lace means no real negatives.\\t\\tI'm not getting much in the way of Belgian yeast esters in the nose, which makes me think the brewers used dark candi sugar, but not Belgian yeast, and called it a day. Not getting the blood orange zest either, just some dark malts.\\t\\tVas Deferens Ale is the first Caldera brew that I haven't enjoyed immensely. While it isn't bad beer, it's a sorry excuse for a BSDA no matter how you slice it. The flavor profile does not fit the style, not least because there still isn't much contribution from the yeast... which is what should be driving this car.\\t\\tSpecifics include toasted pumpernickel, medium-dark fruit, black tea, black pepper and a modicum of citrus zest. That last one isn't immediately recognizable as orange, blood or otherwise. Warming brings a bit more boldness and definition, which is enough to tilt the score in an upward direction. Good sweet-bitter balance and skilled alcohol masking help too.\\t\\tSince nothing else about this brew is Belgianesque, it would unfair to ask the mouthfeel to be. It has neither the medium-full creaminess, the expansiveness, nor the hang-on that it needs to earn the 4.0.\\t\\tUnless you have a passing familiarity with human anatomy and physiology, it's probably best that you don't know what the singing devil on the rather disturbing label is being showered with. Hey Caldera, in the interests of gender equality, how about giving us Fallopian Tube Flanders Red Ale next?\",\n",

Brown sugar, medicinal phenols, bubble gum and ripe fruit make for a Belgian-like aroma. It is crisp and smooth with a bitty mouth- feel. Suggestions of chocolate, oranges, toasted bread and rum come to mind. With modest hops, the alcohol is very prevalent; lots of ripe tropical fruit in tow. Bitter orange wins over the blood orange zest. This beer is not half bad, and certainly worth a try if you can get past the label.\",\n",

There are flavors of malt, sweetness, citrus/orange, and a little bit of molasses undertone. It\\'s impressive that these bold flavors all blend so well, and the beer still manages to be smooth in mouth. There is an alcohol tinge to the flavor, and it is rather pleasant along with the rest of the beer. There is a very smooth finish, as well, and the beer is surprisingly easy to drink despite all the strong flavors and the decent ABV. Pretty decent brew, and it\\'s unfortunate that this is a rare release. I think this could be a decent flagship beer for the brewery.

       "  'review/text': \"22 oz bomber to pint glass\\t\\tPours a rich reddish-brown that, although isn't cloudy or murky, is dark enough to let little light through. It's seems to be amply carbonated, but the small head quickly dissipates leaving little lacing.\\t\\tThe nose is a little flat. Given the description on the bottle, I was expecting something unique and layered, but I could have mistaken this for Newcastle (sorry NC fans). You can pick up a bit of the orange, but given that the label mentions orange was added, you're smelling for it.\\t\\tThe flavors are a bit more pronounced than the scent, but they're perhaps less interesting. You're met with roasted malts and orange, but the flavors don't pop, at all, and they're combined with muddy, earthy tones that becomes cloyingly sweet as the sip progresses. This beer needs something else. Hops, perhaps? Perhaps not, it's simply unbalanced.\\t\\tGiven the wispy head, I wasn't expecting a lot of viscosity and I wasn't surprised. This is light on the tongue and not in a good way, especially for an 8% Belgian. I've noticed some 'chewy' references here - maybe I got a bad bottle? Possibly, but I'm not sure bad batches/bottles change the body much, and this is pretty damn thin for 8%\\t\\tThis beer clearly doesn't work and it's not something I would seek out again, but it doesn't fail - it's not the worst thing I've tried and I like what they were trying to do here. There's a template in there to work from. But if I was Caldera I would go back to the drawing board on this one.\",\n",

       "  'review/text': \"22oz bomber poured to a snifter.\\t\\tA- Pours like a thick motor oil. Ebony tint with a tiny ring of mahogany soap on the brim, otherwise virtually no head. Zero lacing.\\t\\tS- Dark licorice aromas with a little tobacco, smokey char, and a slight bit of alcohol on the tail. Strong undertones of molasses and sticky dark fruit round out the nose.\\t\\tT- A bursting blend of licorice, dark baker's chocolate, burnt sugar (almost creme brulee crust...) with a dominate raw tobacco character. Followed shortly by an intricate smokey char that is kindly humble and not overpowering as it goes down. Balances well with the moderate roasted coffee tones and woody cedar characters that hit mid-palette. It got more aggressive in flavor as it warmed, but for the most part I found the taste to be balanced and smooth.\\t\\tMF- Smooth, velvety and soft. Lower on the carbonation with a slightly soapy feeling in the throat and a lighter dry coffee astringency on the tongue.\\t\\tOverall a nicely crafted, smooth stout. The char and tobacco characters really highlighted the complexity of this beer for me. Pretty good.\",\n",

Holy smokes...this smells terrific...I'm a bit taken shocked that this is so dark and rich smelling... World class...\\t\\tRich deep smooth smokiness mingles with dark bitter chocolate and licorice... The smoky aspects of this set this one apart from others of the style and have me hooked... There's also a big hop presence to this that has me thinking chocolate covered orange or something of that nature.. One thing that I'm really digging is the lack of sheer alcohol present here both in the ABV and the flavor... It's nice to be able to drink the whole bomber and not be blurry at the end... \\t\\tThis is a world class RIS in my opinion... I could expound with adjectives and adverbs and all the fluff but I'll say its one of the most enjoyable drinking experiences I've had... Not over the top in any way...

A touch of what could be very light smoke flickers in the distance. The body is a solid, hefty-leaning medium, with a very light moderate carbonation and a fairly chewy feel.

       "  'review/text': \"On draught at Bailey's, the 2009 Old Growth Imperial Stout is black with a tan collar that leaves light, scattered lace.\\t\\tSmell is big on the caramel, honey, sweeter for a stout, but clearly one nevertheless. The lavender creeps out a bit as it warms, although this was so delicious, I didn't give it much chance to do so! \\t\\tTaste is big, loads of complexity of this one, all the adjuncts combine with the chocolate and roast flavors of the malt to remind me of a really fancy truffle. I particularly enjoyed the lingering taste of the pink peppercorns. For so much complexity from the adjuncts, none of them are over done. Smooth, clean,well executed and exceptionally good. \\t\\tMouthfeel is slick, medium-light bodied, surprisingly, but not in a thin way, just not thick and heavy.\\t\\tDrinkability is good, this is a really nice RIS, super unique. Crazy flavorful, yet smooth and dangerously drinkable. I'm really digging the lavender the most, I can picture myself in Brussels's Grand Plaza eating fancy chocolate, awestruck. Probably not their intention, but a nicely played invocation nevertheless!\",\n",

Lots of grain, mild fruit (say, earthy blackberries?), and a fair amount of piney woodiness. LOVE the spiced honey flavor!\\t\\tM: Lots of grit and grain fill the mouth, stick on the teeth.

       "  'review/text': \"It's helpful to know something of what you're drinking in advance of drinking it. I knew Old Growth was an imperial stout, but I wasn't aware it was brewed with licorice, honey, chocolate, lavender, and pink pepper corns. So when I drew the snifter to my nose and inhaled its essence, I was caught off guard by its peculiar tapestry of fragrances. I kept wondering if the beer wanted to smell and taste as it did, or if bad luck was conspiring against it. I concluded that Old Growth suffered from no unintended intrusions, but I was still perplexed by its uncommon design.\\t\\t\\tI found Old Growth on tap at the Fort George Public House in Astoria where it was featured among other notables as part of Stout Month. Fort George was serving it in 12-oz. snifters where its panoply of sharp aromas was ably focused. Chocolate flavor was featured abundantly, yet the fragrance was also enhanced by a spice mix suggesting mint. The taste worked parallel to this and I was convinced I was drinking a chocolate mint elixir - pure girl scout cookie. \\t\\t\\tOld Growth's body is oily black with sepia froth. Its complexity makes it an anomaly in a snifter but a year of aging at least tempers this with some smoother contours. I came to enjoy it, but it's clearly not for everyone. 10.3% ABV.\",\n",

Sure, there was a bitter backbone on the finish, but only as much as necessary to keep it balanced. This was all about the citrus and floral notes of the finishing/dry hops, nicely complimented by lots of stone fruit, particularly apricot. The malt, like the bittering hops, only served to keep the sweetness and check and relatively balanced. This is the hoppy NW brew I'd been waiting for, and I'm glad found it! \\tThe mouthfeel was medium light bodied with lively carbonation. \\tThe drinkability of this was very high for me. I had two over dinner, it went well with steamed clams, raw oysters and steelhead. It definitely left me wanting more, and I am surely going to seek this out (as well as their Dry Hop Orange).\",\n",

They don't bottle, so I think it's mainly available on tap at isolated spots in southern OR/northern CA. A glass full of clear garnet-red liquid. Sharp hop nose, floral and minty. Modestly malty body two-steppin' with firm, diverse hop bitterness. Quite nice and drinkable.\\t\\tConfused with Dry Hop Orange in other reviews. Fact is, Dry Hop Red and Dry Hop Orange are two different brews from Caldera. Red is maltier and deeper in hue, Orange is fruitier and paler, but both brews are similarly fresh and hoppy.\",\n",

Pours a light tan with golden highlights, with a small, one-finger, creamy white head that takes a few minutes to retreat to a pretty ring around the top of the glass. Aroma of sweet biscuity malt, a faint whiff of tobacco, and a very mild hit of brown sugar.\\t Palate is mild sweet malt up front, with notes of biscuit, light brown sugar, and just a touch of fruitiness. A very slightly chalky bitterness appears briefly before the swallow, with the finish leaving a mild, stone-fruit sweetness lingering for a few moments. Body is just a little thin, but fairly creamy, making this a highly drinkable beer. I'm a fan. Even though it clocks in at a bit higher ABV than most marzens, I could happily drink a couple of these in a sitting.

Fresh- cut grass and nutty yeast coat the palate; hops are fresh with ample bitterness and a good amount of flavor, which brings this beer up a few notches. The maltiness is a bit light, but right where it's supposed to be. Flavor overrides cleanliness. Very drinkable as well.\",\n",

The flavor is quite similar with pale malt sweetness, some grassy herbal hops, clean yeast, grainy notes and a surprising amount of bitterness. I have to say that the flavor is pretty disappointing, even for this style, though the dryness does give it some merit. Mouthfeel is not just light, but watery. It has a nice dry finish and is very quaffable, and holds up alright when compared to other beers in this category, but I think there are better options.',\n",

Very little head but then again most beers of this style don't have much head so in comparison to the style it is good. \\t\\tS- This has your typical lager yeast smell. There is a bready, earthy, grainy and gritty smell. Very rounded and bold smells in terms of beer of this style.\\t\\tT- The beer is crisp and refreshing. I'm getting a big grain taste that is like chewing on the top of a barley stalk. More like the smell of when a grain truck dumps its freshly harvested barley load into the grain grate to be weighed and priced, take that smell and put it as a taste and that's what I'm getting. There is a subtle sweet honey taste that is coming though and adds a nice level of flavor. There is actually a nice complexity going on with this beer, especially when you are comparing it to other beers of the style. \\t\\tM- Good mouthfeel, nice carbination and a very light body.\\t\\tD- Easy to drink, the name of the beer fits very well. I would drink this after working out in the yard no prob. This is clean but not BMC clean. It's more like clean but in a dirty glass type clean. \\t\\tLagers are not my favorite styles of beer. But one thing I've found is that the flavors are more subtle then other styles. Many craft lagers get a bad wrap because of BMC lagers and how many people are so against them here on BA. I rated this beer based on its style, and for its style it is very well done and tasty. I would definitely buy this one again.\",\n",

As my buddy whom this bomber was shared with put it, \"One time I puked up a bunch of Cheetos, this smells like that...\"- While I agree this was very displeasing, I was able to pick out a few herbal notes. This reminded me of a crappy floral tea. I got the rose petal here and there, but it wasn\\'t in a nice delicate aroma; it was more in your face and mixed with DMS.\\t\\tT/M- Not very good. I tried to give this a chance but I couldn\\'t find what they were going for on this. It is all malt with no hops presented in any way, shape, or form. I wonder if they 100% replaced the hops with rose petals? Thats what it somewhat tastes like; though the rose petals still aren\\'t prominent or pleasing to the palate. There just wasn\\'t any saving grace to this beer; it\\'s a shame.\\t\\tO- I hate to say it, but this was a drainpour by both of us that shared the bomber. We tried, I think I did more than he; but in the end neither could stand to go on. I understand the whole experimental aspect of this, and I appreciate it, but I do feel like Caldera missed the mark- whatever that mark may have been. I do love me some other Caldera brews, but this one got away...',\n",

Really great looking.\\t\\tNose really doesn\\'t jump out at me. Pale malt tones with a tea-like herbal tone to it. Really nothing noticeable, and that includes the rose.\\t\\tIt tastes similar to the nose. There is a floral tone to it. Not hoppy floral but like an herbal tea floral. It\\'s difficult to describe. Luckily, I happened to have a bottle of rose water around so I took a sniff of it and I just couldn\\'t make the connection. The beer as a blonde ale is really very solid. The pale malts work wonderfully with the carbo to create an extremely refreshing beer. This would have been nice to have during those 95+ dog days of summer .\\t\\tOverall, it is a solid beer. I have to say though, I had a difficult time pulling the \"rose\" flavors from the beer.

Taste- I got more pine and heavy hop scent on the nose than I do on the first taste, but it is backed by a nice and mellow malt background. This is not a hop monster, but is very mellow and pleasant.

A quentessential IPA look, but even a mild haze would have been alright.\\t\\tCaramel richness and piney, grassy, citrusy scents swirl for a somewhat succulent but pungent and sharp hop scents adorn the rim for a balanced and inviting aroma.\\t\\tFlavors of sun kissed barley malt, deep caramels (almost toffee) and bread crust give a much richer malt contribution to flavor than I'm used to in an IPA. But the hop allow for a zesty flavor of grapefruit, orange zest, fresh cut grass, and spruce that are signature IPA flavors. With no off flavors, esters and phenols to a minimum the beer is well brewed- but the malty rich recipe gives me reason to ponder.\\t\\tSweetness in taste result in a creamier and richer body. Creaminess early lingers well into the mid palate and finish before the hops and alcohol force a terse dryness very very late.\\t\\tA very good beer but the caramel sweetness makes the beer attempt balance where IPA's should be the showcase for hop flavor, aroma, and bitterness. Maltiness also interferes with the body and hinders the crisp and dry attributes needed for greatness in the style.\",\n",

This beer ranges in color from golden at the bottom of the glass, to ruby/amber at the top. There's a nice pillowy, khaki one-finger head that recedes at a snail's pace. Great lacing clings to the edges of the glass. Some moderate carbonation is visible in the glass.\\t\\tSmell: Citrus and pine hop aroma is offset by some sweeter fruit scents and nice caramel malt presence. I'm also getting a touch of bready influence.\\t\\tTaste: The hops are pretty unrelenting in this one. The malt holds its own though, and breaks through the bitterness a bit at the end. There is actually a touch of sugary sweetness just as the bitterness wears off. The influence is brief and barely finds its way through the hops, but it is a nice counterpoint to the bitter onslaught.\\t\\tMouthfeel: Medium-bodied and extremely well balanced. The hops are strong enough to state their case, but subdued enough to let the other flavors have their turn.\\t\\tDrinkability: A very solid, session-beer contender. I love the can too!\",\n",

I drank them all out of the can so I can't really go into any detail on the beer's appearance, so i just averaged it with the rest of the critique.\\t\\tA: I'm sure it was good.\\t\\tS: Sweet and grassy with a bit of malt, but the hops really dominate which is nice.\\t\\tT: Nice grassy kinda piney hop bight right off the bat with some grapefruit flavor in there too, then mellows a bit which allows the maltiness to come through at the end.\\t\\tM: Medium bodied but on the lighter side of medium, mellow carbonation but not under-carbonated by any means, someone used sticky to describe the mouthfeel and that's a real good way to describe it.\\t\\tD: All I can say is that I think this has to be one of the most drinkable IPA's out there. They seem to just go down like nothing- the can doesn't hurt this attribute by any means.\",\n",

Pours with a very frothy slightly off white 2 finger head that dissipates to about 1 finger and leaves a nice lacing all the way around the glass.\\t\\tSmell - The smell has some great pine and citrus qualities from the hops. A very rustic and earthy scent can be found. There are hints of grapefruit and a bit of orange rind. Great presence of the biscuity malt and some caramel sweetness.\\t\\tTaste - Not a lot of that pine and rustic earth come through on the taste but you do get some good bitterness in the form of citrus and the biscuity sweet malt comes out nicely on the end with a surge of fruity grapefruit and orange. All of that is followed by a nice bitter finish. I love the fruity sweetness followed by that bitterness.\\t\\tMouthfeel - This seems a bit watery for my liking, and a bit light too, it doesn't take away from the beer too much though luckily, still great. The carbonation seems pretty good, maybe a bit overcarbonated.\\t\\tDrinkability - This one has good drinkability, nothing amazing, I could definitely drink a few cans. The 6 pack may be an issue but I'd attempt it. \\t\\tGreat IPA, in a can no less.\",\n",

Just arrived in town, so I'm assuming it is quite fresh. \\t\\tPours lightly hazy orange amber with a good two finger foamy white head that leaves some foamy rings of lacing and holds a light foamy cap. \\t\\tAroma features a good deal of citrus, mostly orange/tangerine alongside some papaya, mango, melon, grapefruit, also a lot of pine, a little floral and grassy, a little sweet bready malt. Good strength. \\t\\tFlavor is able to retain some of the citrus fruitiness of the nose, but not all, more resinous hops on the tongue, pine, floral, and a fair bit of sweet bready malt, kinda surprised by the level of sweetness here for an IPA but does help keep it balanced. Fair bitterness on the finish but the sweetness sticks around as well. \\t\\tMouthfeel is medium bodied, oily and sticky, medium carbonation. \\t\\tVery glad to finally try this and it is an excellent well-balanced IPA. The nose is by far my favorite aspect...very nice. While this isn't a straight up hop bomb like a Smuttynose IPA, this one is very well balanced and quite drinkable. Can't wait to try their Pale!\",\n",

The nose seems to be a good indicator, as there's a tendency toward floral & mild pine notes upfront; moderately dense citrus notes are more notable in the middle.

A little bit of earthiness and some spice on the tail end.\\t\\tA beautiful caramel begins at the front of my tongue, followed up by some butter rum lifesavers and sweet bready malt.

Grapefruity hops come through big to start, though this one is all flavor and almost no bitterness - hopbursted? - with a firm layer underneath of toasty caramel malt that is just in absolute perfect balance for an IPA. The hops are clearly the star of the show, but the malt is just dialed in to perfection. Wow. Finish starts with a big juicy-sweet grapefruit burst, and carries a very manageable bitterness that never builds out of control as the finish dries right up.\\t\\tMouthfeel is smooth and creamy, medium-full bodied, maybe just a tiny bit sticky. Really exceptionally done. \\t\\tDrinkability is startlingly good, up there with my best IPA experiences. A really top-tier IPA that I'd heard a lot about, but really wasn't expecting to be as good as it is. Tip of the hat to the folks at Caldera, beautifully done beer.\",\n",

       "  'review/text': \"Now available in NC, and now I can see it and smell it the score went up. A really great canned IPA for the pool /beach or really anywhere. I also like Avery IPA, and Modus in cans, but I would have to give this brew a leg up on either, a little more fruit and hops than the others and at 6.1 ABV really drinkable. Not terribly bitter either, so it would makea great IPA for anyone who wants to step up ftom PA's to IPA's.\\t\\tAlso found the last sixer in Myrtle Beach on the shelf, and what a great surprise. Not only the only the only canned IPA available but a damn tasty one, Drank it out of the can so I have no idea on what it looked like, smelled like or any kinda head retention, but I loved it. I also had some Modus, but Caldera was definitely a little more fruity. IMO a real find, and a real solid A kinda brew. Would have scored higher if not being guzzled at the beach which knocked down the appearance and nose, Drink ability is good but the ABV in the killer heat had to be respected although not a heavyweight in this dept\",\n",

Very hopforward, with a nice malt backbone. Citrus hops pack a punch throughout, with some big bitterness and some resiny characteristics on the finish.

The foam dies down gradually but keeps an even layer on top. Moderate amount of carbonation.\\t\\tS - All I'm getting is delicate citrus, bisquit, and caramel. Not overly aromatic for an IPA and I'm having an unusually hard time picking up any other nuances.\\t\\tT - Light caramel biscuity malt, with a little bit of sugary sweetness at the front of the tongue. The tongue is greeted with caramel malt and almost immediately after is hit with the citrus hopping to keep the sweetness in perfect check. There's a caramel-like grapefruit bitterness left in the mouth and eventually, nothing but grapefruit bitterness after the sweetness dies down.\\t\\tM - Slightly on the heavier side of medium bodied, smooth feel as it rolls over the tongue with the carbonation being more on the creamy side than prickly.\\t\\tD - Very, very good. \\t\\tVery finely balanced.

       "  'review/text': \"Beer review from BA Mag Oct 2007.\\t\\tHooray! for canned craft beer. We really love this format and how quickly it is spreading throughout the US. Options are great, especially when you are in no glass zones such as poolside, on a boat, on the beach--and also simply for the fact that the can is a great space saver. \\t\\tStodgy off-white head, the sticky mass shows its great retention as it stays strong all the way down to the bottom of the glass. Clear copper-penny hue; a few bubbles race to the top. Citric, pine and black tea hop aroma. Hint of melon, estery alcohol and sweet toasted malt in the background. Lots of smoothness to go around--extremely smooth. Slightly chewy medium body shows the malt is not just going to sit back while getting pummeled by the hops. Mild cookie-like sweetness from the malt has a faint toasted graininess to it. Hops come in with a controlled but precise bitterness, strong but still leaving some balance. Big minty hop flavor very slowly dissipates with citric rind, evergreen, black tea leaves and a sweet Mandarin orange flavor. Finishes a little bittersweet with a rock-solid hop flavor and sweet biscuity maltiness. \\t\\tThis is a great example if you are looking to try a Pacific Northwest (PNW) India Pale Ale. Hops all around, both in bitterness and flavor, with enough malt to keep everything in balance. Nothing over the top. It's simply a great IPA--and it's in a can.\",\n",

       "  'review/text': 'This IPA pours a clear amber/orange with one finger of foam that dissipates quickly.\\t\\tAroma is hops, floral and citrusy, with a nice roasted/toasted malt backbone. I pick up grapefruit, flowers, a touch of herbs and grass and a bit of musk smell that I associate with Columbus hops, a nice fresh hop aroma. The malt has a very noticeable toasted/biscuit note, much more up front than many IPAs.\\t\\tTaste is quite smooth overall, the biscuity malt balances nicely with the hop bitterness. It starts with light malt, a tad toasted with a noticeable hop bitterness, this transitions into a brighter, more hop focused flavor. The finish is remnants of biscuity malts and some hop bitterness and citrus. Overall, even a minute after I take a sip, the toasty malt is the dominant flavor on the finish. Quite nice.\\t\\tMouthfeel is medium to thick with moderate carbonation.\\t\\tOverall I very much enjoyed this beer, a big IPA with a strong malt base yet substantial hop flavor. This beer stands out to me among the Northwest IPAs I have tried, it has a very nice balance and a smooth flavor.',\n",

The aroma is typical American IPA with plenty of grapefruit, orange, pine and caramel malt aroma. The taste is hop forward yet pretty well balanced with tons of hop flavor and bitterness, but a decent malt backbone to hold it up. Flavors are similar to the nose with grapefruit, orange, pine forest and caramel malt sweetness with a bit of toastyness as well. Medium bodied with a great finish that is not too sticky or dry and lingers just long enough. Very drinkable and a great, sessionable IPA.',\n",

The eggshell head is real fluffy and big. Retention is excellent, leaving a thick sheet of foam on top throughout the duration of the drink.\\t\\tS: Very pungent nose; tropical fruits like pineapple and slight mango, piny resinous hops, and slight earthy undertones. Citrus (grapefruit and slight orange and lemon peel) is also apparent. Alcohol peeks through the nose a little bit, but doesn't take away from anything. Malts give a firm base and seem like they will balance nicely.\\t\\tT: A little different from the nose...the 94 IBUs really shine and give off a puckering bitterness. Earthy, resinous, and citric hops make up a majority of the flavor. I don't know exactly what gives this flavor off (I have the same thing in my dry hopped IPA that was brewed a few weeks ago) but it tastes like the smell of whole hop flowers- slightly vegetal...I did dry hop with Simcoe so maybe thats where it comes from. Malts lend a caramel and toffee backing that helps to balance, but seems to be consumed by the hop bombardment. \\t\\tMF/D: Smooth and creamy feel. Pretty big body for the style. Carbonation is awesome- at the ideal level in my book. Not necessarily a complete palate killer, but close to it. This makes for a good outdoor occasion IPA.\\t\\tNotes: Solid IPA.

       "  'review/text': 'Wow, the canned IPAs just keep coming my way... and they can continue to do so! I cannot complain. New to my blighted and \"Famously Hot\" city of Columbia - the heart of Darkness of South Carolina - Caldera IPA is a welcome reminder that I once lived, nay, was even born in the Pacific Northwest.... and someday may be blessed to return.\\t\\tThe Caldera can itself is a rather ugly yellow with lots of hop cones around a, uh, caldera (cauldron) and the whole thing is rather an affront to the eyes, perhaps designed by a 2nd year art student who dropped out to smoke dope and lie on the beach with his rotund black lab and pierced girlfriend, but what do I know.\\t\\tCaldera IPA is a dull, clear deep yellow, with a nice head that never really dies and some nice sticky lace. Smells good, but not great - pungent and resiny West-Coast-Yo hops, malt is regulated to the background. Grapefruit and some citrusy fruit, a smack of booze. Taste is similar, more hop-bitter forward, a bit thin, sweet but not terribly characterful malt. No real surprises here, but it\\'s not bad. A fine finish, adequate carbonation and some finishing hop bitterness turn this into a pretty solid IPA.\\t\\tCaldera can\\'t quite hang with the big dogs, and at a price of $12 a six pack has to do a little more to justify itself in my mind. This is a good IPA, but the world is rife with good IPAs... I would gladly drink this anytime, but if my distributor is reading this, man, have you seen what $12 buys you on the streets of Ashland these days?',\n",

Great head retention which hangs around for a good 10 minutes. There are two fairly prominent floaties in here; not sure if they're hops, or pieces of Oregon.\\t\\tS  The aroma is a little subdued, but what I'm getting out of it, I like. Lots of really earthy pinecones and trees, orange marmalade, light grass and a fair amount of caramel dipped bread.\\t\\tT  I don't see a date on the can, but I think this might be on the older side. BUT, being just over the hill doesn't stop this from being delicious. The hop profile is on the mild side, but maintains for the entire taste with fresh cut grass, lemon soda, barely bitter grapefruit and spruce. The malt that backs all of that up comes out in toasted nuts, lightly sweet caramel, hearty rye bread. There is a really nice balance going on here  while I would like the hops to stand up a little more, the malt profile is still second fiddle. But even though the malt characteristics take a backseat to the hops, the nut+caramel bread combo is fantastic.\\t\\tM  No problems here  medium bodied, a touch on the syrupy side with an understated carbonation pop.\\t\\tO  Easily a beer I could drink by the six pack. Also would be good for a newer ipa drinker who need some malt balance and isn't bitter to the point of no return.\",\n",

Very full flavored. \\t\\tM- Medium, not too light but not heavy. \\t\\tO- A great IPA, I am not the biggest fan of piney IPAs but this one has just a touch of it then followed by fruity hops (my preference).

Lots of nice citrus and tropical fruit flavors but not so much piney-ness. \\t \\tTaste - graprefuity, tropical fruity, bittersweet and tongue drying. Plenty of malty sweetness backing up this dry mouth inducing IPA. The hop profile is very pungent and fresh coming from the can and this one lives up to its billing as one of the better canned IPAs on the market (of which there are more and more). Great job to all those at Caldera! Keep up the good work and I look forward to trying your other canned offerings. \\t \\tOverall - great IPA in a can! Very drinkable and well balanced (which is what really makes this one stand out). Fresh hop flavors is well preserved in the can and the overall drinkability is excellent.\\t \\tWould I buy more of it? - Well, I was lucky enough to get a few cans of this via several trades so its not so much a matter of buying it again as it is getting it through other means again.

Plenty of frothy sticky icky lace - whitish, messy and organic like foam off the ocean. A lingering head that leaves plenty of webbed lacing down the glass.\\t\\tSmells like an artists interpretation of hydroponic marijuana. Incredibly dank, backed by a tight jolt of crystalline sugar. Smells of wild fields of flora and fauna. In my head I am brought to my knees, imbibing in nature's melody. In for one more whiff... DANK! High in the nostril a hint of potently sweet floral hopiness surfaces and then disappears. Wow.\\t\\tThat nose is expressed well in the mouth. Starts wet and slightly sweet, attaining a Noble hop bite on the front of the tongue. Low sweet caramel notes hold things briefly in check but the hopiness only continues to grow from the front to back. In the middle a plethora of fruity notes emerge - grapefruit, lemons and oranges. In the next flash though its the earthier, piney hop that begins to shine. By it's finish the show is brutally bitter - it 'Arcs' only as it finishes. A puckering bitterness that again brings to mind the wild tastes of a forest. Hops are pooling on all sides of my mouth with pine-like bitterness. My tongue is buckling, and I'm wondering if I'm as much of a hop head as I think I am. The hops are imposing their will on my senses, and I'm starting to beg for mercy. The brewer has fortunately carbonated the hell out of this beer. The hydrophobic (read: oily) resins are minimized by all the surface area provided by these bubbles. This produces a light/medium body with a lot of texture. I am catching an alcohol heat in the back of the throat that is not totally pleasant. Drinkable, HUGE, challenging.\",\n",

Straightforward, no questions to be asked.\\t\\tTaste: I'm impressed - Caldera's Pale Ale was a real let down, but this is quite solid; lots of bitter hops right up front -- very piney and that citric fruit peel that is oh so nice and bitter and not juicy at all (not that juicy is bad either, but this one is straight up bitter); faint malt presence offers a little bit of sweetened balance, but the bitter dominates; fairly strong metallic aftertaste, but it's still really good and doesn't downplay the solid flavors too much.\\t\\tMouthfeel: Strong carbonation makes it feel very crisp and lively; body isn't thin, but not quite thick either -- about where I would like an IPA; a nice stickiness from all that hop resin coats the roof of the mouth quite nicely. \\t\\tDrinkability: Actually, I could probably drink this all day; nice solid bitter flavor with a crisp and refreshing body; would be great for a hot summer day, but I can't complain about drinking it when it's 15 degrees outside either...\",\n",

Brilliant clarity.\\t\\tWhile there is strong citrus in the nose (with tell-tale orange zest), the Simcoe hops seem the most pronounced of the three utilized, with their distinctive forest-floor/pine contribution. There is also an herbal borderline \"catty\" note that I didn\\'t notice the last time I tried this beer (though since it is canned I don\\'t think it was light-struck!).\\t\\tMint, orange pith, and pine needles on the palate with an undercurrent of pale malt. Unripe citrus bitterness with a bit of lemon/lime but no grapefruit. Finishes rather dry and faintly toasty. A little less pronounced malt that many NW IPAs - though more than most IPAs from SoCal.\\t\\tZippy, resinous, and highly carbonated - this is quite refreshing. An excellent choice for car camping or a fishing trip.',\n",

Some hop resin stuck around after each sip. Light tropical fruit in the aftertaste. \\t\\tD- Very drinkable IPA in my book.

A nice off white head sits on top that leaves behind some frothy and bubbly lacing.\\t\\tS: Looooads of grapefruit and pine are right in your face, I think I'd be lying if I said I could smell any of the malt backbone.\\t\\tT: Loads more of the bitter grapefruit and pine flavors right up front with a sweet citrus flavor that follows. Some mild caramel in the middle, but straight back to the grapefruit and pine at the end. The hop flavor in this beer is INTENSE. Once it warms up a bit you start to get a lot of pineapple and orange as well. This beer just keeps getting better.\\t\\tM: Dry, well carbonated, light bodied, crisp.\\t\\tD: This beer is delicious, I wish I could get it here in Boston.\",\n",

There's visible carbonation running throughout, feeding a short, well-retained white head. There's a tremendous amount of sticky white lace that marbles the sides of the glass without any signs of fading. \\t\\tSmell is all hops - aromas of grapefruit rind and earthy, musky hops come through. There's only the slightest indication of sweetness from the malts. \\t\\tTaste definitely reflects the largely hop-forwardness of the aroma. The bitter citrus rind presence in most detectable in the aftertaste, and a hint of the piney, oily sticky hops hits the tongue early on. There is more of a malt foundation in the taste, but it is hardly sweet - more toasty, full and warm. The aftertaste is really nice; it makes me want to wait between sips to enjoy it a little more. Feel is bright and perfectly carbonated - not too much and not too little. It fills the mouth and spreads the flavors around the palate very well.\\t\\tThis is one highly drinkable beer. I was tempted to drink it from the can because you don't see that all that often with crafts. I went for the glass, and enjoyed every last drop. Definitely recommended for a try. It is a solid, everyday IPA.\",\n",

I already drank one of my three this morning before even writing anything down. My notes for Ashland Amber included commentary on the CAN itself, including verbiage and mention of CAN-conditioning. This, however, was a visually appealing CAN with vibrant color reproduction and a green pop-tab. My buds at that stoner joint, Roots (http://beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/10996/?view=beerfly), would fully dig this CAN. Hey, before anybody gets their panties in a bunch, a) I kid and b) I CAN pass a urinalysis standing on my head. I dig beer, you dig? Plus, that place has a really smoky vibe and I am sure that they would not be particularly offended. Onward.\\t\\tBoth times, my pour has begun with a finger of ecru head which has simply sat down, leaving sticky Belgian lacing in its wake. The nose is forest hops - pine, green, earthy, sticky, massive. Sweet hops the hope of my life - once again, that damned howling monkey shut up and climbed off of my back for the moment. I am on the waiting list for hops rehab but it's a long list and I may not last that long. Thank Bob for hops! \\t\\tIt now becomes a simple matter of drawing some of this delectable beverage into a syringe through a needle and jamming said needle into one of the few remaining viable veins. No heating necessary. Cold fusion is more satisfactory, anyway. Once I untie my rubber hose, the euphoric quality begins to set in. I am one with the Beeriverse. My existance is justified. I'm not just a simple Hophead. I am a HopJunkie and an unapologetic one, at that. My licking the lacing out of the glass is starting to draw stares from the nieghbors. So what?!? The heck with them! This is my scene, man, and don't mess with me while I'm digging it. Find your own scene and report back. \\t\\tMan, how do I convey veinfeel over mouthfeel? It was righteous! Full, sticky, veinous (not vinous), right on, baby! Finish was hoppy, sticky, yummy, the EMTs are trying to restart my heart, man. Zounds!\\t\\tWhere am I? Was this a review? Wow, man. What a groovy trip. Did you dig the scene too, or was it just me? I gotta get in the shower, man. I'll try anything once.\",\n",

       "  'review/text': \"PREMISE: I have been considering moving to Oregon, and this IPA may very well have put me over the edge. \\t\\tA - I was happy to see a real nice amber color to this beer as I poured it from the can into the glass I had just retrieved from the freezer. The only other canned beer I have tried recently that I can recommend is Dales Pale Ale. Many people cannot believe that a decent beer can come from a can. For the most part, I agree. This, as with Dales, is an exception. Knowing a decent canned beer is valued quintessentially to those of us who enjoy the back-country experience and like to pack out what we pack in. There is something special about being able to stick a couple of really good ales or IPA's in the snow on a telemarking trek and enjoy that beverage in the raw and untamed wild. I have had a few such occasions in the beautiful Arapahoe Nat. Forest of Summit County, CO. \\t\\tThis ale poures into a chilled glass easily with a two to three finger, full, creamy head and leaves a sweet lacing on the glass, all the way to the last sip. The well carbonated ale continues to offer a flow of small bubbles consistently as it stands in the glass. As for the appearance, I have to say that I also am quite fond of the labeling. Anyone collecting cans should have a Caldera IPA in the line-up.\\t\\tS - The smell of this beer is what you want folks who think beer stinks to sample. I could imagine Caldera IPA incense, the smell is so natural and becoming. I used to appreciate deeply the aroma of the pines and aspens as I guided horseback tours in the Colorado Divide, and this is what Caldera reminds me of. \\t\\tT - Caldera IPA tastes delicious. I love hoppy beers and this satisfies while I would say it won't scare off those who like a hoppy beer but are somewhat easily offended. It has a nice bitterness that says a solid hello from the tip of the tongue around both sides, but doesn't try to rip apart your mucous membranes with the vigor and skill of pissed off Norseman. The flavor is complex, sensuous and mystifying. The finish is crisp and clean and as I am experiencing at this very moment, one simply is not enough. My glass is in the freezer right now getting prepped for a second round. \\t\\tM - This IPA has a full bodied, smooth and delightful feel that is welcome on the palate, to be savored and swallowed slowly, eyes closed and head tilted slightly aft, slowly exhaling through the nose to extract the many intricacies that the craftsmen at Caldera have steeped into this marvelous 12 ounce can. \\t\\tD - At 6.1%, this IPA is very, very drinkable. Beware, if you are not on foot and close to home while enjoying Caldera IPA - it can sneak up on you. Filling? Not terribly for such a well built and hardy concoction. \\t\\tTHE FINAL ANALYSIS: If you enjoy drinking beer, you must try Caldera IPA - especially if you like to drink out of bounds.\",\n",

Purple ring around the top points out all the advantages cans have over glass for outdoor activity.\\t\\tA - Medium copper, clear, not much carbonation present, head was small and disappears rather quickly. \\t\\tS - Pale bready malt, citric hops. Not overpowering, but definitely there. \\t\\tT - Citric hops beat out the malt from the get go. If you are a hop head, you will like this for just a \"regular\" IPA. Bitter in a good way.\\t\\tMF - Light to medium bodied. Crisp. Dry. Very nice.\\t\\tD - $8.99 per six\\'r = $1.50 per 12oz. Cans a 0.5 adder too. So very drinkable given the price, medium body, and can.\\t\\tOverall - This is a great IPA can or not. Can doesn\\'t give any residual metalic taste that I can pick up (when drinking from a glass). I will take this over a pour into a red plastic cup at the beach (I will test that theory tomorrow!)\\t\\tGood one. Got to try others from Caldera.',\n",

The aftertaste of so many hops does take down the mouthfeel a bit, but the taste is definitely...tasty!!!\\t\\tM: The hops sting a bit, even in the mouthfeel, but the malt is moderately thick, which helps wash everything down. The only drawback I can see is that the hops stick around so much in the aftertaste. It wants me to drink more, but it still is a little surprising.\\t\\tD: This is a good IPA. Almost like a Firestone Pale Ale supercharged; the hops are front and center, and the malt does its job to try and balance it, but the overall impression is HOPS. I like this, and like the idea of cans, but this is NOT for folks who don't like it bitter!!\",\n",

So it pours into the glass a lovely toasty bronze-rust color, with a crazy-fluffy head that looks like the top of a root-beer float. Lasts a long while too.\\t\\tNose is ultra-hoppy...very much veering into the fresh fabric-softener breeziness area. Not much else behind it, but gotta love it.\\t\\tFlavor is delightful hoppiness all the way. Bright, breezy, a bit intense but not overwhelming. The malts carefully and successfully offer backup, or maybe more of a foundation than anything, as the prickly, colorful hops continue to be the magical ingredient with each sip. A little green, a little leafy, and very, very nice unless you're not into hops. A slight twist of graininess that reminds of rye carries through, especially into the finish. Also some candy-like sweetness, especially with a little warming.\\t\\tMouthfeel is neither here nor there. Not much to say about it, but it's fine. It's a medium-bodied beer with some prickly carbonation and a bit of stickiness.\\t\\tA very solid IPA, and a very drinkable west-coast version of the style. It's not over-the-top while still exuding the character of its region, and the ABV makes it completely manageable if you're wanting several in a row.\",\n",

Served cold and poured into a pint glass, this one was consumed on 06/26/2009.\\t\\tThe pour was very nice. Deep amber in color with a nice clarity to it. A big head of white coming up and over the top and settling down with a good amount of side glass lacing. Big aroma of fresh hops on this one. Just a huge nose of grapefruit, pineapple and hints of orange peel. Deep and resionous, almost sticky just in the aroma. As the first sip hits, not as sharp and pungent as the aroma, but seriously this was a good IPA. Nice and tight with the fresh hops letting your lips stick to your teeth. Lots of pineapple and grapefruit leading the way but fading into a nice mid palate of buttery malts. Nice medium feel and an easy, very smooth sessionability.\\t\\tOverall this was excellent. A very easy to drink, very nice and very hoppy west coast IPA. I would go for this one again any day!',\n",

Grapefruit and peppered orange slush. Spiced apples and limes. Hints of fresh herb and cannabis.\\t\\tT: This is a juicy lemon crisp beer with black pepper finish. Solid hops taste that is strong but not overwhelming. Much like the nose this is crisp and refreshing tasting. Slight buttery malt backdrop but overall this is all about the hops. Leaves a strong bitter aftertaste that goes perfect with some spiced foods. \\t\\tM: Juicy with perfect carbonation. Sticks all around the mouth.\\t\\tD: Since I have been in a can craft beer zone recently this psychedelic yellow six pack caught my attention. These drink quickly and easily. A little pricey at $10.99 a six but it ended up being a pretty good investment. Very impressive IPA. New Valis album goes well with a number of these.',\n",

Poured into a 0.5L Ayinger glass (\"Echte Bierkultur Geniessen\") from a 12oz. can. Had a sip of this one golfing and had to give it a proper review.\\tA - nice, slightly hazy dark orange/amber color. A nice rocky head forms off the pour and a thin layer clings to the glass and hangs around all the way down.\\tS - Nice hoppy nose off this one, with some maltiness mixed in.\\tT - Funny how your brain needs to adjust when drinking out of a can; first sip of this was during a round of golf, right out of the can and my first thought was, \"wow, this is GOOD beer\" because you\\'re expecting something thin and watered down. A \"proper\" tasting confirms my first sip; poured into a glass, this is a damn good, drinkable IPA. Nice hint of sweetness up front which is quickly run over by a nice rindy, bittery-y flavor which hangs around on the tongue for quite a while between sips. \\tM - This drinks pretty smooth; carbonation is pretty low but the bitterness hangs around for a while (in a good way). \\tDamn solid IPA; highly recommend grabbing it if you spot it somewhere (especially you East Coasters).',\n",

The malts come through more than in the aroma. \\tMedium bodied. Somewhat low carbonation, again resembling a nitro beer. A little sticky/oily.\\tPretty drinkable. Nice flavors and body. Not too boozy, but not quite sessionable.\\tA quality entry in a crowded beer style. I was glad to try it, but there are just as many good ones available locally too.',\n",

Including Caldera IPA. Not only never heard of the brew, no clue the brewery even existed. \\t\\tThe pour is the initial use of a Flying Fish glass that marcpal sent me recently. Clearly he read my mind about the need for smaller glasses in the house. Thanks Marc!\\t\\tThe 12 oz. goes into the tulip with about an ounce or so to spare. The smell knocks me for a loop, a bitter, disgusted, angry, fucked-up hophead's dream searing my nostrils. I was kind of looking at this as a nice, gentle way to start off the night. What did I get myself into? \\t\\tAh, I see. I got myself into a kick-ass IPA I've never heard of before. The taste is aggressively hopped, pleasantly oily, bitter, sharp, clean, & all the things a good IPA claims to be. Wow. First-class IPA. Really, really good. \\t\\tI could drink these all night. \\t\\tThanks Mr. Hophead, I am going to put this on my wants list hoping people will drop a can or two in as extras. The only thing preventing me from trading for it is the existence of a local brew, Surly Furious, maybe you've heard of it. This is...almost...no. I can't even type it. It's close. Great beer.\",\n",

       "  'review/text': 'A decent pour from the can produces an almost three-finger thick, light tan colored head in my large Tripel Karmeliet tulip. The beer is a light amber color, but shows a brilliantly clear, orange / red tinged, full copper hue when held up to the light. The aroma is definitely hoppy, though not aggressively so, there is also a fair amount of malt character that accentuates a sticky hop character. Aromas of candied orange zest, ruby red grapefruit, caramelized oranges, some touches of pine and green herbal notes and, towards the finish, a touch of cracker like grain and lightly toasted malt.\\t\\tSlightly sweet, somewhat light bodied, but definitely hoppy. A nice bitterness clings to the palate and lingers for quite some time in a long, bitter, dry finish. Up front the bitterness takes on a decidedly herbal note with touches of hemp, biting pine flavors and a bit of herbal / green-grassy notes. This is definitely nice and quaffable, it is not overly sweet nor thick for an IPA, though the hop character definitely tends to cling to the palate. The first sips, as well as sips where I have gone and done something else for a while, have a much more prominent citrus hop character (with orange zest, grapefruit notes, kumquat and perhaps a touch of lychee); otherwise the herbal and bitter hop flavors dominate.\\t\\tThe flavor is much more harsh and aggressive than the aroma suggested, but it will certainly still be enjoyable for the hop heads out there. A solid IPA, that could actually use a touch more malt, or to dial back the herbal and bitter hop character.\\t\\tPurchased: Liquid Solutions',\n",

Finish turns bitter and dry with an underlying peppery hop quality that keeps things pretty interesting.\\t\\tD: This was a very nice surprise. This IPA drinks exceptionally well. Excellent balance between bitter & dry hops and sweet maltiness.\",\n",

       "  'review/text': \"Can as an extra from flexabull in a trade - thanks! Poured into a traditional American pint glass.\\t\\tAppearance: Pours a healthy-looking clear orange amber-bodied brew. A mild pour coaxed a good one-plus finger white foamy head with above average staying power that leaves some sticky, creamy lacing as it fades away, sort of randomly thrown across the sides of the glass. Very good start.\\t\\tAroma: Great west coast aroma. That one-two citrus-pine combo is so traditional for a reason - it smells great. This one's not overstated, and compliments the roasted, sticky, doughy malt backbone well. \\t\\tTaste: Expertly balanced. It's not too bitter or too malty, and the maltiness isn't too sweet or too dry. Hop profile is a little milder than I'd like, but more so than a lot of IPAs - I'm just very demanding of my hops, I suppose. Leafy floral notes, pine, and lots of grapefruit makes for a good hop profile.\\t\\tMouthfeel: Medium-to-full bodied, fairly fluffy, but very even and creamy, precisely what you'd expect from the look of the head. Carbonation is precise and pronounced, a little prickly, and the hop oils increase the slickness factor ever so sightly.\\t\\tDrinkability: A great, drinkable, sessionable IPA in a can that hits all the right notes without knocking any of them out of the park. But that's not what you're looking for with this one. Portable, tasty, aromatic, pleasant looking ... this one definitely comes recommended, and many thanks to flexabull for sending this one my way.\",\n",

       "  'review/text': 'Caldera IPA flows out of the can into a nice clear orange/light amber color with a nice fluffy white head. Nose smells of west coast hoppage and some malts. Taste follows, good grapefruit hop flavor with some spiciness in there as well. A good malt backbone, but not overwhelmingly sweet. Mouthfeel is pretty much just what it should be, but could be just a touch thinner. Drinkability is very good here, as this one is defenitley summer slammable. Overall a good beer, solid session IPA, and a good option for those seeking craft portability. Its not Oskar Blues, Its not Surly, but its still craft beer in a can baby.',\n",

       "  'review/text': 'Caldera IPA is my new best friend. And I\\'m wondering if the can has something to do with it. \\t\\tFor decades canned beer deserved the stigma attached to it. The aluminum adversely impacted the taste, lending a tawdry metallic quality that was the hallmark of industrial beer production. This problem has been solved in recent years by coating the inside of the can with a food-grade polymer that effectively keeps the beer off the aluminum. No more unsavory beer can taste. \\t\\tToday it\\'s not merely a matter of acknowledging that canned beer \"works.\" It\\'s now prudent to ask whether it\\'s an altogether better idea than beer in a bottle. And Caldera\\'s IPA is a fine candidate for the notion that canned beer is an idea whose time has come. \\t\\t\\tCaldera IPA\\'s aroma is floral and leafy. The leaf is so fresh it\\'s almost sticky. It imparts a tall airy head of majestic suds amid lively carbonation in a sunny topaz color. The body is vivid and clear though marred by a few wayward flocs.\\t\\t\\tThe taste reminds me of Fire Station 5 with perfectly posited bittering that takes your hand and walks you through a lush garden of herbal hop flavor. Piney, peachy elements interweave from an ideal balance of hop flavor and malty sustenance. And the mouthfeel is flawless - plush, meandering, and exquisitely quaffable. Even the head delights in its own fluffiness.\\t\\t\\tAn ideal go-to beer for any occasion.',\n",

Light lacing is left behind as the head shrinks. It is a hazy transparent golden orange color.\\t\\tSmell - Damn, this smells pretty awesome. The scent of candied orange explodes out of the glass. Almost like Sunkist orange soda spiked with hops - but without the artificial orange scent. Very bright. Citrus rind and sugar and the primary scents that I detect. \\t\\tTaste - The taste is nice, but nowhere near as nice as the scent. Citrusy hops and slight cracker-like malts make an appearance in the initial flavor, with a thin sugary sweetness in the middle and then runs flat - all before a surge of bitter hops rounds out the backend and aftertaste. It isn't balanced by any means - but it is tasty. If only it tasted as good as it smelled.\\t\\tMouthfeel - The mouthfeel is pretty nice. There is are tiny, very fine textured carbonation bubbles that prick the tip of your tongue as you sip, and then runs creamy by the time it hits the back of the throat. I would have enjoyed a little more carbonation in the backend to liven things up, but I always enjoy a beer that can be both crisp and creamy at the same time.\\t\\tDrinkability - This is a very solid brew. It is a nice, easy drinking beer, but I wish that it had a more balanced flavor - or at least a flavor that tasts as good as it smells. The hops seen to be a little out of whack - I would have enjoyed a more prevalent malt profile. But it smells awesome, and I do get my hop fix. If this was available in Texas, I could easily see this becoming a part of my regular beer rotation.\",\n",

Like their Pale Ale I just reviewed, this is the first time I've ever not had this beer in a can, but I'm not nearly as impressed. Served at fridge temp.\\t\\tSmell is pure, resiny cannabis - ah, Oregon! To be more specific, it's more of the cat piss style, which you probably won't care for unless you have the mental association. I was just working on my goggle tan at Mt. Ashland this past Wednesday, and by the number of heads goofing off with me on a work day, it's obvious this town operates on a slightly slower speed. With a smell like this, I think Caldera's trying to remind us there's always time to chill...\\t\\tTaste is pungent, resiny hops, firm malt backbone with a big bitter finish. The slightest touch of sweet caramel malt loses the battle to the big buds, which pack enough lupin to knock out Bobby Brown on a 3 day coke binge. \\t\\tMouthfeel is creamy but dry and crisp, with a heavier body. \\t\\tDrinkability is average. I like a lot more hop flavor then bitterness, and this IPA is pretty much the opposite, and a bit thick for my taste as well. I'll still give it bonus points for the can, not to mention that dank aroma that I never noticed from the can.\",\n",

       "  'review/text': 'I was SO pleased to see this at my local liquor store. Finally I have some good locally crafted canned beer that I can take into the wilderness this summer, and that makes me very happy. \\t\\tPours a bright light gold color with a very nice white head.\\t\\tAromas are very earthy, and resin like. There is also a hint of hard candy sweetness. Very nice nose on this one.\\t\\tBeer has a very hoppy flavor to it. Mostly like the aromas, earthy and resin like, with some pine like flavors as well. There is a bit of subtle underlying creamy malts, and a finish that is crisp, tart, and bitter.\\t\\tMouthfeel is thick and full. Very nice feel for an IPA.\\t\\tDrinkability is good. This is a nice IPA. Very solid, well made, and tasty. The flavors are actually surprisingly strong, almost DIPA like. This is still a very nice beer that I am glad is now available to me, and in a can too!',\n",

Aroma is chalk full of hops grapefruit, floral, and piney varieties blend wonderfully tickle the nose with citrus peel like fury. As it warms more of a complex earthiness with mild tree bark notes ring out but underneath all those hops a subtle layer of malt sugars arise bringing out sweet candy like notes. Flavor is upfront with brash bitterness yet enough malt sweetness comes out to party, this is west coast style IPA all the way. Hop bitterness reigns supreme with grapefruit citrus peel bitterness and more of that earthy dirt layer coming through. Mouthfeel the hop bitterness consumes your palate it really sticks around it makes you feel like you have to scrape the hops off your tongue, I love it. Once again I love the can format, this is great to get this much hop flavor out of a near 6%abv brew coming right out of a can. Next time I hit up an outdoor event where drinking takes place I will remember this beer and wish I had at least a case on hand. Very green yet biscuit malts and mild caramel twang make so drinkable the palate gets used to those brash bittering hops and adjusts to all the other flavors my palate has a found it's equilibrium and no shit this is an outstanding IPA in a can. Hoppier than Gordon DIPA.\",\n",

It has the look and leaves the lace of a beer that contains a generous amount of hop resins. At least I hope so.\\t\\tThe nose is nicely hoppy, but it isn't explosively hoppy. I blame the fact that the brewers decided to use too much Munich and crystal at the expense of pale malt. The hops (Crystal, Galena, and Centennial) provide grapefruit and orange esters, along with a strong whiff of ganja. Close to excellent, but no cigar. Edit: by the last ounce... cigar.\\t\\tI feel the same way about the flavor... at least after two mouthfuls. Who knows what time, warming and the rest of the can might accomplish? These guys definitely love to hop their beer, but then that's almost a requirement in Oregon, isn't it? I wish the website listed the IBUs. I'm thinking 70ish.\\t\\tThe sturdy malt backbone, again, contains a healthy amount of toasted earthiness from the Munich and steely caramel from the crystal. It also provides an underlying sweetness that keeps things from being more arid on the back end than they already are. Caramel-soaked orange and grapefruit pith and peel zings across the tongue with each mouthful, leaving shallow alpha acid furrows rather than deep trenches.\\t\\tThe mouthfeel is IPA medium; perhaps a bit more full due to a wonderful creaminess as it gains a few degrees. The amount and feel of the carbonation strikes me as just about right. Are all 12 ounces gone already?\\t\\tPrior to Surly blowing the entire concept sky-high, Caldera Pale Ale was my favorite canned beer. IPA is at least as good. It's a terrific, drinkable beer that I have no trouble recommending to anyone, hophead or not. If you have a few slots to fill in your Liquid Solutions order, you could do much worse than to fill them with either Caldera Pale Ale or Caldera IPA.\",\n",

Smells like there is a decent amount of malt on this one to balance as well.\\t\\tTaste- Rich fluffy hops and a very nice light malt bringing in the rear. This is a nice balanced IPA, there is a bit of metallic can character as well. \\t\\tMouthfeel- The metallic flavor comes in and lingers on the mouthfeel. The carbonation seems to wear down quite a bit as well. Still a medium bodied, crisp beer.\\t\\tDrinkability- The drinkability on this IPA is quite good. This is the sort of beer one could stand to have by the 'suitcase' although it has more of the maturity for the established craft beer drinker. Great swilling beer.\",\n",

Another classic phrase regarding keeping the beer at a proper temperature: \"Live Product. Keep Cool, Just Like You\".\\t\\tA: Pours a light amber color and immaculately clear with almost 4-fingers of billowing sandy tan-colored head. Fades to about 1/2-finger. What remains is both rocky and creamy, full of both bubbles and crust. Hardly any carbonation and a faint suspended haziness. \\t\\tS: Aroma is all citrus, full of pithy grapefruit and traces of lemon and sweeter orange. What caramel malt there is is folded into a neat envelope of juicy hops.\\t\\tT: Pithy bitterness sprays from this IPA from the first taste. There is very little malt getting through here; this is an fairly unbalanced hop explosion. Lots of grapefruit bitterness and pine resin - very little caramel malt or other sweetness getting through. \\t\\tM: Medium mouthfeel, but with a long-lasting hoppy cling. This has orange, grapefruit and pine nesting on the center and back of the tongue. Carbonation is low and somehow the mouthfeel is fleeting and just a little thin.\\t\\tD: A good IPA, certainly worthy of grabbing one (or a 6-pack) if in Oregon. I think hopheads will really enjoy the full citrus-hop flavor from this, although I found it just a little one-dimensional/overbearing. A flavorful IPA I\\'d certainly have again, however...',\n",

Esters are barely detectable, blending in with and complementing the hops. The fruit flavors give off a funky tropical quality, like durian. Acidity is restrained--detectable but never distracting. Husky toasted grain becomes more assertive in the middle, and moderate bitterness develops in the finish amidst continuing malt and slightly astringent hops.\\t\\tM: Medium viscosity, smooth and slightly sticky on the palate, with very low carbonation.\\t\\tD/O: It seems like many of the IPAs made by the smaller production breweries struggle almost predictably with some facet of the style--all in the pursuit to be unique in order to stand apart from the pack. This contribution from Caldera is fairly unique in its qualities, but it manages to stay appealing. Its abv is on the low side of the normal range for the style, adding to its approachable nature.

I tried several times to get any aroma at all. I do pick up a faint aroma of orange, pineapple and other citrus notes. No pine smell at all.\\tTaste is average. Not anything surprising or breath taking. No real note supercedes the rest. Faint hints of orange and citrus fade to a very faint sign of pine on the end.\\tI rated the mouthfeel better after reading the abv.

Taste is similar to the aroma, it's mostly hops with some sweet malt noticable too. There's also a nice lingering bitter hoppy finish. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's slick with moderate carbonation.

The head is almost completely white, and the body is a reddish, orangey, amber color, it looks more like an amber than an IPA, but the head color and body color look really nice together. I can tell the head is a solid one, it is clearly leaving good lacing, it didn't hang around too long though. If it had better head retention I would probably give this a 4.5, but since that head went a little fast, 4. Nice citrusy hops on the nose, along with a very clean smell. The beer just smells super clean and fresh, like they used really good water or something. You can also pick up a nice malt note in there, it is pretty distant, but for sure there. Maybe some grapefruit in here too, not sure. The smell is very nice though, it smells like a very good IPA. Well on the taste, it for sure has enough hops, it's not a weak IPA, that's for sure. The taste is really just like I detected it would be on the smell, it's really big on the hops, and it has a very small malt note in the back end. Frankly I'm surprised at how much more hop there is than malt, I guess I just haven't had a really good (or hoppy, if you will) IPA in a while. Not super complex other than the basic tastes, but it is super well done none the less. The mouthfeel is also pretty good, nice solid feel to it, not too big, not too small, just right. Drinkability is a little low just because it is so damn bitter, but I can't be upset about that, that just means it's a good beer! Overall a damn good beer, not extraordinarily complex, but a very well done beer, there is really nothing wrong with this beer at all.\",\n",

The head is sticking around for a really long time. Excellent retention and excellent lacing.\\t\\tS - This is by far the fruitiest smelling IPA i have ever had the chance of enjoying. Pineapple and mango DOMINATE the aroma. I dont smell any citrus or pine. Some maltiness is pressent, but the fruit dominate the aroma profile for me. \\t\\tT - Piny and resiny hop flavors mixed with less prominant citrus and pineapple. The flavors are very crisp and clean. The sweetness that i smelled is not as present as i expected. Very well balanced.\\t\\tM - Medium bodied with medium carbonation. Well balanced hop bitterness and malt sweetness. Fairly sticky from the resiny hops.\\t\\tO - A great IPA. The aroma is second to none and it helps that it drinks as well as it smells. Its just high enough in ABV that i wouldn't want to session this beer. I also love the can and think that more beers need to be sold in cans. I will buy this again whenever and where ever i can find it.\",\n",

Someone could have told me this was a pale ale with IBUs around 50-60, and I would have believed it. Still, it was an enjoyable beer, and I'll be keeping an eye out for others from this brewery.\",\n",

Mostly sweet pineapple but the hops aren't that noticeable. Very sugary as well. But I do have to give it points for being pretty strong in the nose even if it isn't showing bitterness. The bitterness is fairly sharp in the front but it fades into a kind of cheapish sweet corn and cereal like lager. Aftertaste also leaves a lot to be desired. Actually after the initial bitterness there really isn't much other flavor besides the corn and more bitterness. Pretty one dimensional. A bit too overcarbonated and kind of leaves a bad feel in your mouth. Well it is easy drinking. I can give it that. Heard a lot of good things about this beer. It failed to impress me. No canned/best by date so who knows how fresh it is. At $12 a six pack this beer is total fail! I didn't even see the price til it rang up and I thought it was a mistake and had to look at the screen to make sure. Even if it was pretty good that price is pretty bad.\",\n",

       "  'review/text': \"Thanks to larryi86 for this 12oz can--poured into a Bell's pint glass. Preface, I can recall many a pleasant afternoons spent in SE Portland drinking this at Otto's accompanied by a smoked sausage. \\t\\tA- Golden amber color with a whitish head. Not sure if I dropped the can before pouring, but the head was two and half fingers when poured moderately. Reduces to a firm thorough covering the lasts. Plenty of lacing on the glass. No visible carbonation bubbles.\\t\\tS- Hops! Complex mixture of grapefruit, grassy, and herbal tones. Not much malt. Very very hop forward. \\t\\tT- Wish it tasted like it smelled minus the grassy aroma. Bitter at the front and end. I taste white onion throughout. It is quite the hop wallop, but the onion seems to be the main taste (had nothing to eat before tasting, so no lingering food tastes). Minus the onion, I think this would be dead on.\\t\\tM- Medium body with minimal carbonation. Dry finish on the tongue. Lingers bitter with that onion taste.\\t\\tD- Still would drink it for nostalgia reasons alone, but it holds up. Perfect for mowing the lawn or a softball game. It is easy to drink.\",\n",

Retained about a finger of off-white rocky head. Very true to the style in appearance.\\t\\tSmell: Nothing overwhelming but nothing off here, either. Hops, citrus, some grassy-floral componenets as well. To me the malts took a back seat, without letting the hops being overwhelming or one-dimensional. Soft-smelling, I would call it.\\t\\tTaste & mouthfeel: Essentially the same as the nose, with a grapefruit-like flavor as the main culprit. Hop bitterness makes your tongue tingle initially, and the sharp grapefruit levels out into a slight lingering bitterness. The malts are light and toasty but seem distant. Again, a little 'soft' but not one-dimensional. The mouthfeel is extremely crisp and it dries you out on the back end. I consider this a light bodied beer.\\t\\tDisgustingly drinkable.\\t\\tEdit to Note: I was just getting over a cold when I tried this, so I will re-review in the future. If this really is as bitter and hop-forward as some of the other reviewers are saying, I will be upping my grade for this beer.\",\n",

The Caldera is not available in Illinois at this point, so I was excited to try a new West Coast IPA and this was no disappointment. \\t\\tAPPEARANCE: Brilliant gold-copper in color with a quarter-inch, very homogeneous and bubbly, white head. Not bad retention, as it slowly faded over the course of a minute or so.\\t\\tSMELL: Pine and floral aromas dominate the smell, but mild malt and grapefruit smells are present as well.\\t\\tTASTE: This is a hoppy, bitter beer and it is delicious. The hops dominate from start to finish in this beer and balance is a relative term in this case, however, there are enough grapefruit and floral flavors to ensure that the hops don't completely destroy the palate. Very dry all the way through, particularly in the aftertaste. \\t\\tMOUTHFEEL: Well carbonated, the Caldera sparkles from start to finish while it dries and bitters the whole way through. \\t\\tDRINKABILITY: This is what a West Coast IPA is supposed to be all about - bold, bitter and biting. This is not a beginner beer, it is for the seasoned hop head who can appreciate every IBU packed into this brew.\",\n",

Thirty delicious beers on tap and this was the first I tried (hey, I'm a Southern Oregon man, plus my girlfriend wanted something a little fruity). The orange flavor was vibrant and quite simply amazing. Sweet, but not too sweet, and not overly bitter. The hops and orange flavor played very well together. I would love to try it once again, if I can find it.\",\n",

       "  'review/text': 'Tried this beer recently on-tap at Tugboat Brewing in Portland, a pint glass at Happy Hour - May 1, 2007. Pretty sure I\\'ve had this before...\\t\\tHere\\'s the description from Caldera\\'s website for this year-round offering:\\t\"A conundrum in the world of beer styles. This ale does not fit any conventional beer style. Orange in color, this beer has hop characteristics of oranges and tangerines. Grist: Premium Two Row, Crystal; Hops: Amarillo, Cascade, Horizon; Original gravity: 1.052; Alcohol by volume: 5.4%.\"\\t\\tA: Beautiful, slightly hazy honey-orange color. Light to moderate fast-rising carbonation. Topped with a creamy, off-white head, about 1-1/2 fingers, gently fading. Good lace.\\t\\tS: Malty caramel, a touch sweet. A piercing hop sting - definitely orange/citrus-smelling. \\t\\tT: More toffee-maltiness than I\\'d expected, but offset with that \\'orange\\' pith taste the hops contribute. What starts sweeter ends more on the side of bitterness. Good flavors and nicely balanced overall.\\t\\tM: Creamy, medium mouthfeel, carbonation seems a little light. Ends with a little sticking malt and a slightly metallic hop bite on the back of the tongue. This analogy may sound weird, but it felt like a quarter was being pressed down on my tongue...\\t\\tD: For a beer without a definitive style to grade against, I can really just say that - yes - it was enjoyable and - yes - I would get it again.',\n",

       "  'review/text': \"Poured from a bomber into a shaker pint glass.\\t\\tA: Clear, light reddish-amber color with one finger of lofty off-white foam head. Moderate lacing remains on the glass.\\t\\tS: A faint combination of floral and piney hops that also feature some toast and mixed fruit.\\t\\tT: Begins off-dry, with malt-focused flavors of toasted bread and caramel that increase in sweetness. Hop aromatics are floral but muted. Astringency emerges in the middle as acidity peaks at a moderate level. The finish possesses diminishing qualities encountered earlier, mainly floral hops and esters, with moderate bitterness.\\t\\tM: Medium viscosity, slightly sticky on the palate, with moderate carbonation.\\t\\tD: If a brewery that cans most of their product puts a beer in a bottle, does that mean it's special? In this case, the answer is no. It is a very malt-focused IPA that features an underwhelming smell and some rough flavor edges. Ultimately Caldera's standard IPA wins out, with this beer as a hybrid IPA/DIPA that just lacks characteristic abv and hop intensity. This mis-step does little to shake my confidence in Caldera, considering the mastery shown in other beers such as the barrel-aged Mogli or their rauch bock. I do have to question the source of their interest in this particular recipe.\",\n",

Review is from notes on 10/16/10.\\t\\tA: Pours a dark gold, bordering on amber with a tint of orange into a snifter. A half finger khaki head vanishes quickly, leaving a washboard film pattern on top. Thin, straight lines of carbonation move slowly up the glass. Small dotty lacing with a couple of arches is moderately sticky. \\t\\tS: I am not sure when this was bottled, but caramel malts are edging out the Centennial hops in my nose. Sweeter citrus notes of orange and lime and a dry, bitter hop character exist in the background. A hint of spiciness is also evident. \\t\\tT: The malt to hop balance is better than I thought it would be. Caramel malts are the dominant flavor, but citrus hops and nice dry pine and grassy hoppiness on the finish provide a counterpoint to the malts. \\t\\tM: This is a solid medium feel for an IPA with a coating sensation from the copious malt presence. The finish is a drying hop suck on the sides of my palate. \\t\\tD: HK is not my ideal IPA with the citrus hop notes a bit of an afterthought in the taste, but it is still pretty tasty. I do not think I would seek this out again, but I did enjoy drinking it. Oh yeah, the label is amazing. I love the little hop men knocking on the door to the cosmos - classic.',\n",

A substantial amount of caramel sweetness balances the beer. A bitter aftertaste is present. This is a pretty generic tasting DIPA.\\t\\tThe carbonation is moderate low.\\t\\tThe drinkability is ok.

       "  'review/text': \"Enjoyed with TCHopCraver. Thanks to zoso1967 for supplying this tasty brew!\\t\\tAppearance: Split two ways and poured into a large snifter. The beer pours a hazy copper/orange with a small head that recedes pretty quickly. A small ring of lacing made of large bubbles is left after the head recedes. Some scattered streams of carbonation are visible in the glass.\\t\\tSmell: I was expecting more in the way of hop aroma, but the bottle did sit a while, so perhaps that has something to do with it. There is some fairly decent citrus and pine notes, as well as some grainy malt aroma and a bit of something musty in the background. There is also a touch of spice present; almost reminiscent of a saison-type influence.\\t\\tTaste: There is definitely more bitterness than the smell leads on. The flavor is pretty well balanced with a decent malt profile. There's not a ton of complexity here, but it is a pretty decent representation of the style.\\t\\tMouthfeel: Medium-bodied, creamy texture, with some biting pine notes. Fairly dry finish, and there's definitely some lingering bitterness there.\\t\\tDrinkability: Pretty easy drinker, but a little more on the malty side than your typical IPA. Definitely enjoyable though; I'd certainly reach for another.\",\n",

Appears quite oily and dense for the style and the carbonation looks like it's struggling to escape. Lots of foamy lacing.\\t\\tS: Citrusy grapefruit aroma and lots of pine. There is a faint sweetness in the backdrop, but the overall nose seems a little dampened.\\t\\tT: Bitter, grapefruity hops crash the palate, balanced by a touch of bready, slightly sweet malts. The hops are powerful here but they work well against the honey sweetness. There's some orange and lemon zest in there, and the alcohol has a warming effect halfway through each sip. As the beer warms, grassy, earthy, almost floral flavors can be detected. The beer finishes pleasantly bitter and dry.\\t\\tM: This is a fairly rich, chewy beer and could pass for a DIPA in its texture. The carbonation is perfect for this style and nicely washes away each sip. The taste is much more vibrant than the nose, and I wonder if that's due in part to its oily, full-bodied composition.\\t\\tD: This is a total hop-bomb, but as your palate adjusts to the aggressively bitter hop profile you'll find this brew quite balanced. I noticed myself drinking faster as I was writing this review.\\t\\tNotes: Overall, quite impressive. This could easily pass for a California IPA and could stand up against some of the better known hop monsters coming out of SoCal. I'm really particular about IPA's and fairly skeptical about unknown renditions, but after finishing a pint I'm surprising satisfied.This is the first offering I've sampled from Caldera and they've passed my IPA test with flying colors, so they'll be on my radar.\",\n",

       "  'review/text': 'This beer pours a wonderful copper amber with only a slight white head and decent lacing. The aroma is very complex with plenty of pine and citrus hops, but also some toasty roasty malt character that is not overpowering and quite nice. The flavor follows the same path. Very bitter with a huge citrus and pine punch to the taste buds, as well as a groin kick of roasted and caramel malt. I have to say, I thought this was just a normal IPA, but it seems to be leaning a bit more towards an American strong ale/Black IPA in flavor. Astringency and bitterness fight a battle royal in my mouth, and I am lucky enough to have a front row seat. The mouthfeel is on the full side of medium, and has one of those sticky/dry finishes that are common in beers of this gravity and hop load. Not the most drinkable for style, but still goes down pretty easily. I really like this, and am glad it comes in a bomber.',\n",

Very nice head, but the body's a bit dark and murky for an IPA. \\t\\tSmell is skunky, some citrus, earthy spice too. Nice floral sweetness, but not the blistering hops I expected from the label. \\t\\tTaste is pretty citrusy, spicy hops, but not to strong. Big bready malt backbone, moderate bitterness, definitely on the malty side or an IPA, more like a hoppy amber or pale ale. Marketed as such, I'd have scored it higher. I don't really like big malty IPAs. \\t\\tMouthfeel is slick and oily, there's a thinness to this, almost cask like, in spite of the chewiness of the malt. \\t\\tDrinkability is okay, but with a name like Hopportunity Knocks, I was expecting a much hoppier brew. This one is a new release and I bought it from a cooler so I'm sure it's pretty fresh. OK but not special.\",\n",

Its quite frustrating to travel 600 miles round-trip to sample a beer as close to the source as possible, only to get a bad pour. Am I the victim of an arbitrary occurrence or a systematic glitch? Cant say. But readers may check out my review/rant for Calderas Oatmeal Stout to learn why I hold the brewery at least partly responsible for the quality of their beers as dispensed through their hometown accounts. \\t\\t\\tMeanwhile, Ill attest that I have reason to believe that Ashland Amber is otherwise a popular local favorite under ideal circumstances. It has a very up-front hop presence for an amber and I imagine that theres a fine brew lurking about somewhere beyond the tainted lines of Ashland Creek. I hope someday to find it.',\n",

The head is pretty much totally white, where as the body is a standard amber color, there are hughes of orange in here as well, the beer is see through is some areas, but for the most part completely non transparent. it looks ok, nothing special. The smell leads me to think that I'm not going to like the beer, it's all malt on the smell, almost no hops to speak of, and an amber ale should have some hops in there. Not only that, but the malt smells like it's the kind of malt I really don't like, the malt that tastes like it smells before you even brew the beer, just a complete grain taste. We will see, but the smell doesn't give me high hopes. Well on the first taste I took I couldn't really detect any hops, and frankly I thought the beer was extremely boring on the first taste. However, on the second and third sips, the hops are coming out a little bit more. The malts are for sure not too bad, they aren't really the kind of bad taste I was detecting on the smell. This is a very drinkable beer, and not bad by any means, but I frankly wish there was more taste to it. On some tastes this beer deserves a 4, but on others it deserves a 3.5, so I dunno. The taste just isn't as bold and powerful as it could be, but it is crisp and refreshing, and it does have some nice flavors to it. The mouthfeel isn't too bad, a little thin, but it does have some girth to it, not too bad. Overall a good beer, not amazing, but good. Frankly I can't find anything too wrong with it other than the smell, but I guess it just wasn't hitting on all cylinders for me, for some reason. I could totally understand and respect this beer getting a A- from someone else, it just wasn't doing that for me today.\",\n",

Decent look.\\t\\tSmell is a sucker punch in the nostrils. Not sure what I was expecting from this brew, but the nose was a big surprise. Overhwelmingly bitter and floral, with caramel sweetness singing backup. Maybe I should start believing some of the hype about cans preserving the beer so well.\\t\\tAs surprising as the pungency of the smell was the incongruity of the flavor profile. Just plain uninteresting in contrast to the huge nose- a dash of floral hops, not a ton but enough to outweigh the barely-there malt backbone. Out of balance and generally weak. \\t\\tSeems like some soft, mellow bitterness evolves once the beer is gone. In fact, I think I enjoy this beer more after the swallow. \\t\\tDecently smooth and inoffensive, but not worth a second visit.',\n",

That same barley character holds over into the flavor with a mix of pepper and lemon peel. The bitter aftertaste is a touch earthy and balances the sweet malt nicely. It's not the most flavorful, but at the same time the body is on the lighter side, making for a drinkable amber. Overall, a respectable session beer.\",\n",

This may be a simple recipe but it sure has been perfected. This has the perfect balance of maltiness and some citrus hops to balance things out. The malt profile is something I am really enjoying, I'm not sure how best to describe it. I'd have to say its somewhere between honey butter and brown sugar cinnamon Pop-Tarts. Well, maybe not that sweet but it is surely delicious. \\t\\tOverall - great amber ale, one that I could definitely enjoy in multiple amounts. I love the flavor that this imparts and the great balance that it has with the PNW hops used. Amber Ales may not be my favorite style but this is proof that I could love any beer if its brewed well. \\t\\tWould I buy more of it? - absolutely.

       "  'review/text': '12 oz. can poured into a trusty pint glass. Pour nets an inch of cream or light tan head crowning a crystal clear medium amber body. Decent retention and lace. The aroma hits the nostrils with the same blend of hops that is familiar to me from their pale ales, lots of resiny pine character. Second to that is a lightly nutty caramel malt element. Taste has a mild sweetness which turns into a crisp resinous hoppiness. Caramel or nougaty malt balance pops up in the midpalate as well, but the finish splits nicely between malt and full on hops. High level of hops for an amber, actually very close to the pales, but I like this better with the malt balance. Medium thick body with a creamy medium carbonation. Recommended, my favorite Caldera of the three cans I have tried.',\n",

Instead, I got a whiff of piney hops, a scent of malty sweetness, even a slight black pepper smell. Mouthfeel was medium to full with a caramel-malt taste that I would expect on the tongue. The finish, however, was both piney and peppery on the extreme, lingering finish. Initially, I got the same caramel sweetness, but it became overwhelmed. Yow!

Its recent availability in cans provides a welcome addition to their two other canned ales, this one in a colorful display of purple and green on silver. Ashland walks on the dark side of amber and is built on a core alt structure. Its doughy aroma corkscrews through piecrust and malt sweetness while the taste has candied caramel with no more than balancing hops. Good clean fun. \\t\\t\\tInstructions: first, remember that canned beer is good. Next, don't be lulled into thinking that canned be should be served cold.

       "  'review/text': \"Fairly standard of American Amber Ales, which all tend to be a bit sweet and boldly bitter with little hop flavor or aroma- definatley malt forward.\\t\\tThe beer decants into one of my fancy-schmancy Sam Adams pint glasses with a brilliant copper hue, fair head formation, fair retention, and with some mild lacing. Great color and clarity.\\t\\tAromas of biscuity maltiness and caramel-toffee prevail with only the lightest hint of herbal hop aroma. Simple understated fruity esters help to add variety to the aroma without bullying. A simple malty aroma.\\t\\tFlavors of caramel and toffee prevail along with soft butterscotch and sorgum comming into the finish. Again, biscuit sweetness and herbal hops make a direct transition from the aroma to flavor. Malty flavored but also a lot of unresolves sweetneess. Fruity notes here and there help with the complexity but keep the flavors from becomming as clean as they could be.\\t\\tA bit disjointed in texture because of the unattenuated sugars leaving a film on the mouth. But also shooting for dryness with the sharp bittering hops which cause too much of a bite going past the throat. Still malty throughout with grain flavors and textures late.\\t\\tAgain a nice but ordinary Amber. The hop bitterness doesn't seem to be supported with the pleasant hop flavor or aroma, and allows the hops to bite too much. Those who like sweeter, English-style ales may find this one appealing. Reminds me a lot of Anerson Valley Boont Amber.\\t\\tThanks BlueOkie!\",\n",

Three fingers of thick and creamy foam sit atop the beer and look damn good while doing so. Large sheets of Swiss cheese-like lace stick to the glass.\\t\\tThe nose has a bit too much toasted-nutty-earthy malt for my liking, but then that's what makes Ashland Amber an amber ale rather than an APA. The Cascade and Galena hops aren't as prominent as they are in this brewery's Pale Ale and IPA, but then that's what makes Ashland Amber...\\t\\tLeave it to Caldera to give Ashland Amber more hops than beer of this style usually sees. Maybe that's why I like their stuff so much. Malt (pale and crystal) has not been slighted. It tastes and feels like there's a considerable amount of barley present, especially for the ABV.\\t\\tSpecifics include steely caramel, roasted peanuts, bitter black tea leaves and a prodigious shaving of grapefruit peel. The beer is balanced in terms of malt flavor vs. hop flavor, but bitterness supercedes sweetness at all points along the way. This is well-crafted beer that is a pleasure to drink.\\t\\tAll things considered, the mouthfeel really is excellent, as the visual and auditory cues said it would be. It's full and lush for the style and the ABV, which makes it the highlight of an already enjoyable experience. Hey guys, can you teach other brewers how to do what you do?\\t\\tAlthough I'd take Caldera Pale Ale and Caldera IPA over Ashland Amber any day of the week, this is a wonderfully hoppy amber ale that just about any craft beer lover should enjoy. I would dearly love to have easy access to these brews.\",\n",

Not a good start, but there have been other times where I've smelled something similar in ambers and haven't been let down by the flavor so I'm optimistic.\\t\\tTaste: Mostly getting the toasty malts and some of the mildly bitter hop presence, but not much else overall it's very mild... Not bad, but I have definitely had much more flavorful ambers that rate much higher than this.\\t\\tMouthfeel: Body is thin and water and a little flat; finsih is wet and is like drinking malt flavored water. \\t\\tDrinkability: Overall, it's not hard to drink, but there's not much reason to do so. The flavors are mild and meek, the body is super watery and doesn't offer much, so I don't feel I will be drinking this again.\",\n",

I wish Caldera would consider bottling or canning this.\",\n",

I'd venture to say also that this is one of the best Porters I've had in a long time. The beer is close to black in color a thin brown head. The nose has hints of milk chocolate, bourbon, vanilla and oak. In my opinion that is the best nose composition a porter can have. The beer has a medium body and mild carbonation. As it moves across the pallet a strong flavor of dark chocolate hits your tongue with light hints of coffee and bittering acids. Caldera is known for their love of hops and this beer is no different but the hops add to the beers complex flavor profile. This beer could only be better if it had a fuller body and more vanilla and bourbon notes on the pallet. I loved this beer and would recommend it to any dark beer lover.\",\n",

The presence of alcohol is also handled well here because alcohol flavors are not detectable.\\t\\tM: Medium viscosity with low to moderate carbonation. This beer is very smooth and gently warming on the palate.

Despite its spirit-infused imperial pedigree, the palate is not fatigued over the course of drinking a glass.

According to the beer label, this \"dry, refreshing honeyed ale\" is brewed with Welsh honey from the New Quay Honey Farm. The brewery website also lists down numerous awards won by this beer: \\t* Gold award for best golden ale at South Devon CAMRA beer festival 2007. \\t* Double Silver Medal winner at SIBA West & Mold beer festivals 2006. \\t* Double silver medal at The Great Welsh Beer & Cider festival 2007 & 2008.\\t\\tA: pours a bright tawny hue with mixture of fine and huge bubbles in action, topped with a lingering white fluffy head.\\tS: upon the opening, a whiff of skunky note escapes from the bottle, albeit not pungent; in the glass, the aroma has resinous notes of hops, sweet/syrupy orangey citrusness, and intensity of nectar (due to the honey?) all coming before a lighter performance of biscuity malts... a swirl gives rise to a rather focused and clean flow of spicy-floral touch of English hops on top of the settled citrusness (a bit like Challenger to me).\\tT: the taste is yeasty, earthy and slightly grassy from the start (in a pleasant way), carrying with it a \"settled\" pale ale maltiness (with hints of raw-ish grains) and lightly sour-sweet citric+honey flavour; gradually, the latter two elements (sort of) intertwine to result in a clean palate of lingeringly aromatic honey-malty aftertaste, leaving ample space for the moderate-level hop bitterness with its tangy-citric edge to develop quietly at the back of the palate.\\tM&D: not bad in terms of bottle-conditioning, as shown by the refreshing (but not sharp) carbonation and a sound body that stays intact throughout the drink; somehow the honey is perhaps (too) well-consumed and leaves little trace in the beer, as compared with malts and citric hops, dragging down the performance a bit if one looks to have adequate honey pleasure of any form in his glass (like me).

Aroma was not very strong but very inviting. Taste was slightly peppery and smooth. Hopping was with the Columbus variety. mouthfeel was rich and decadent. It also went down pretty well so drinkability is nice.\\tWhile I enjoyed this beer I thought the flavor lacked something and there was a slight bit of aftertaste I wasn't too nuts about. Maybe the brewers need a little work on their cask brewing or else it dosen't get as many calls due to ignorance. Still a good brew.\",\n",

The hops are there, but not too pronounced. It's a bit sweet, and after the slight hints of spice and banana have subsided, it leaves with a bit of alcoholburn.\\t\\tOverall the brew is ok, but a bit boring.\",\n",

While it doesn't elicit any excitement, I sure as hell have smelled far, far worse in a beer.\\t\\tTaste: Excruciatingly thin flavor of ultra pale malts imparting a touch of sweetness and a hint of sourish grains. Sparsely spicy hops with just enough light bitterness to be noticed. The finish is both dry, clean, and crisp, but somewhat short, so Amstel Light is a lot like life, really. One minute it's there, and the nex---\\t\\tMouthfeel: Light-bodied. Medium-plus carbonation. Bordering on being watery.\\t\\tDrinkability: Sure, it's uninteresting and comes up a tad watery, but it IS a light lager. Harmless and forgettable, if it weren't for these humble notes, I'd be hard-pressed to recall the details.\",\n",

Very different from many of the CANned light beers that I have drank of late. Finish was slightly dry, kind of refreshing. It would probably be more satisfying on a hot day.\",\n",

In the Netherlands, it is often not allowed to drink \"normal\" pilsner beers before and during a football match (because of the alcohol). So instead of alcohol-free beer, the stadium management decided to serve low-alcohol beer. Seems a fair choice, and, on top of that, this low-calorie beer also suits any diet ;) \\t\\tPoured into a plastic beaker. The beer poured a typical yellow-straw pilsner color, with a big fluffy head. \\t\\tSmell: almost not there, some malts. That\\'s it.\\t\\tTaste: Like a normal pilsner, only weaker. Malts and hops, with some strange, dusty taste in the middle that I cannot really describe (some type of grain maybe).\\t\\tMouthfeel: thin and watery. Medium carbonation\\t\\tOverall: Well, what to say. Not a great pilsner, as my fellow BA-members also indicate in the rating. However, I think that most people here seem to forget, that this beer has almost NO calories. Given that fact, I think the brewers did a great job, still being able to put so much taste in.

At least I got to see The Roots for the 38th time.\\t\\tA- Amstel Light lives up to its name having a very light pale yellow body that looked thinner than me at the time. A thin white cap stood on top for a few but it had no legs, hence no lacing.\\t\\tS- Amstel does not smell like much and whats there is not inviting. Old grain with a light toast to it. A very light malt addition and even less when it comes to hops and a bit of corn in the back. When it warmed this smelled downright skunky.\\t\\tT- The smell on this pretty much sums up the taste as well. Grain, malt, and just a touch of bitterness on the end. Some yeast comes out but does not enhance the flavor. A taste of corn has me thinking this is a glorified american macro, even though im being very generous with the word glorified.\\t\\tM- Thin, light and watery with a big blast of carbonation. Swishing this in the mouth really brings out the grain bill. They were not lying when they said this was a light lager.\\t\\tD- The ABV on this was actually 1.5% less than what I thought it would be, now I see why people can drink the hell out of this at a bar or similiar setting, but I ask myself why, this stuff taste like impending doom. Amstel light is good enough if your trying to pass the time at a party that you dont want to be at in the 1st place, so it's got that going for it, but nothing else.\",\n",

Not so much fun to smell- this one almost reminds me of malt liquor.\\t\\tT- The taste is significantly better than the smell. There's some hop bitterness, in sort of a dusty or dirty earthy kind of way. And while the corn flavor is there, it's way toned down from before, giving the chance to at least notice some malt flavor.\\t\\tM- Also not awful in this department. The bittereness makes an attempt at balancing out the corny sweetness, though it does fall far short. If the carbonation was higher I might even give this one a 3.\\t\\tD- Drinkable? Well I could probably chug a couple of these. Now would I want to? A much better question, and the answer is no. Though in a pinch I would take this over a BMC lite.\",\n",
