Like previous offerings, the course covers basic Machine Learning concepts and various approaches for Recommender Systems. Topics include:
* Regression (Least-Squares Regression, ML basics)
* Classification (Na√Øve Bayes Classifier, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, Model Evaluation)
*  Recommender Systems (Jaccard/Cosine/Pearson Similarity Functions, Collaborative Filtering, Latent Factor Models, One-Class Recommendation, Bayesian Personalized Ranking, Evaluation Metrics - Precision/Recall, AUC, Mean Reciprocal Rank, Cumulative Gain and NDCG, Feature-Based Recommendation)
* Text Mining (Sentiment Analysis, Bags-of-Words, TF-IDF, Stopwords, Stemming, Low-Dimensional Representations of Text)
* Content and Structure in Recommender Systems (Factorization Machines, Group and Socially Aware Recommendation, Online Advertising)
* Modeling Temporal and Sequence Data (Sliding windows and autoregression, Temporal Dynamics in Recommender Systems)
* Visual Recommendation (Complementary Item Recommendation, Fashion and Outfit Recommendation, Fit Prediction)
* Ethics and Fairness (Filter Bubbles and Recommendation Diversity, Calibration, Serendipity, and Other "Beyond Accuracy" Measures, Algorithm Fairness)

## Homework

### [Homework 1](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/classes/fa23/cse258-a/files/homework1.pdf)
- Basic Logistic Regression and Classification Tasks on [GoodReads Fantasy Reviews](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/classes/fa23/cse258-a/data/fantasy_10000.json.gz) and [Beer Reviews](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/classes/fa23/cse258-a/data/beer_50000.json) datasets.

### [Homework 2](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/classes/fa23/cse258-a/files/homework2.pdf)
- Implemented Logistic Regression with One-Hot Encoding, Precision @k and BER, and Similarity-based Rating Predictions on [Beer Reviews](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/classes/fa23/cse258-a/data/beer_50000.json) and [Amazon Music Instruments](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/classes/fa23/cse258-a/data/amazon_reviews_us_Musical_Instruments_v1_00.tsv.gz) datasets.

### [Homework 3](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/classes/fa23/cse258-a/files/homework3.pdf)
- Implemented Similarity-based Recommendation and trained a regressor to predict game playing time on Steam data (head start of Assignment 1).

## Assignments (Projects)

### [Assignment 1](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/classes/fa23/cse258-a/files/assignment1.pdf)
- A continuation of Homework 3 to optimize and fine-tuning parameters for models in Homework 3. 
- To predict if an user would play a game, given userID and gameID, I implemented the Bayesian Personalized Ranking Model, fine-tuned Adam optimizer learning rate and model's regularization constant, and performed an ensemble with popularity-based recommendation method.
- To predict an user's play time on a given game, I implemented the Latent Factor Model with bias terms only. Then, I fine-tuned regularization constant and performed an early stop (when validation MSE starts to increase) to avoid overfitting issues.
- I eventually achieved a pretty good performance for both models, particularly for the play prediction model. My performance on the course leaderboard is as follows: 

|          Task          | Private Leaderboard Rank | Public Leaderboard Rank |
| :--------------------: | :----------------------: | :---------------------: |
|    Play Prediction     |          11/603          |         20/603          |
| Time Played Prediction |          44/603          |         68/603          |
